<p>In the earlier part of this voyage, and where it was most
wished for, along the dangerous coast of France, fine weather
came.</p>
<p>Next there was an amphibious interlude to the Paris
Exhibition, while the Rob Roy sailed inland.</p>
<p>Thence her course over the sea brought the yawl across the
broad Channel (100 miles) to Cowes and its Regattas, and to rough
water in dark nights of thunder, until once more in the Thames
and up the Medway she was under bright skies again.</p>
<p>Cooking and sleeping on board, the writer performed the whole
journey without any companion; and perhaps this log of the voyage
will show that it was not only delightful to the lone sailor, but
useful to others.</p>

<p>It was a strange and pleasant life for me all the summer,
sailing entirely alone by sea and river fifteen hundred miles,
and with its toils, perils, and adventures heartily enjoyed.</p>
<p>The two preceding summers I had paddled alone in an oak canoe,
first through central Europe, and next over Norway and Sweden;
but though both of these voyages were delightful, they had still
the drawback, that progress was mainly dependent on muscular
effort, that food must be had from shore, and that I could not
sleep on the water.</p>
<p>In devising plans to make the pleasure of a voyage complete
then, many cogitations were had <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>in the winter,
and these resulted in a beautiful little sailing-boat; and once
afloat in this, the water was my road, my home, my very world,
for a long and splendid summer.</p>
<p>The perfect success of these three voyages has been due mainly
to the careful preparation for them in the minute details which
are too often neglected.&nbsp; To take pains about these is a
pleasure to a man with a boating mind, but it is also a positive
necessity if he would ensure success; nor can we wonder at the
fate of some who get swamped, smashed, stove-in, or turned over,
when we see them go adrift in a craft which had been huddled into
being by some builder ignorant of what is wanted for the sailor
traveller, and is launched on unknown waters without due
preparation for what may come.</p>
<p>I resolved to have a thoroughly good sailing-boat&mdash;the
largest that could be well managed in rough weather by one strong
man, and with every bolt, cleat, sheave, and rope well-considered
in relation to the questions: How will this work in a
squall?&mdash;on a rock?&mdash;in the dark?&mdash;or in a rushing
tide?&mdash;a crowded lock; not to say in a storm?</p>
<p>The internal arrangements of my boat having been fully settled
with the advantage of the canoe experiences, the yacht itself was
designed <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>by Mr. John White, of Cowes&mdash;and
who could do it better?&nbsp; She was to be first <i>safe</i>,
next <i>comfortable</i>, and then <i>fast</i>.&nbsp; If, indeed,
you have two men aboard, one to pick up the other when he falls
over, then you may put the last of the above three qualities
first, but not prudently when there is only one man to do the
whole.</p>
<p>The Rob Roy was built by Messrs. Forrestt, of Limehouse, the
builders for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and so she
is a lifeboat to begin with.&nbsp; Knowing how much I might have
to depend on oars now and then, my inclination was to limit her
length to about 18 ft., but Mr. White said that 21 ft. would
&ldquo;take care of herself in a squall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore
that length was agreed upon, and the decision was never
regretted; still I should by no means advise any increase of
these dimensions.</p>
<p>One great advantage of the larger size, was that it enabled me
to carry in the cabin of my yawl, another boat, a little dingey
<a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> or punt, to go ashore by, to take
exercise in, and to use for refuge in last resource if
shipwrecked, for this dingey also I determined should be a
lifeboat, and yet only eight feet long.&nbsp; The childhood <!--
page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of
this little boat was somewhat unhappy, and as she grew into shape
she was quizzed unmercifully, and the people shook their heads
very wisely, as they did at the first Rob Roy canoe.&nbsp; Now
that we can reckon about three thousand of such canoes, and now
that this little dingey has proved a complete success and an
unspeakable convenience, the laugh may be forgotten.&nbsp;
However, ridicule of new things often does good if it begets
caution in changes, and stimulates improvement.&nbsp; Good things
get even benefit from ridicule, which may shake off the plaster
and paint, though it will not shiver the stone.</p>
<p>Thoroughly to enjoy a cruise with only two such dumb
companions as have been described, it is of importance that the
man who is to be with them should also be adapted for his
place.&nbsp; He must have good health and good spirits, and a
passion for the sea.&nbsp; He must learn to rise, eat, drink, and
sleep, as the water or winds decree, and not his watch.&nbsp; He
must have wits to regard at once the tide, breeze, waves, chart,
buoys, and lights; also the sails, pilot-book, and compass; and
more than all, to scan the passing vessels, and to cook, and eat,
and drink in the midst of all.&nbsp; With such pressing and
varied occupations, he has no time to feel &ldquo;lonely,&rdquo;
and indeed, he passes fewer hours in the week alone than many a
busy man <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>in chambers.&nbsp; Of all the people I
have met with who have travelled on land or sea alone, not one
has told me it was &ldquo;lonely,&rdquo; though some who have
never tried the plan as a change upon life in a crowd, may fear
its unknown pleasures.&nbsp; As for myself, on this voyage I
could scarcely &ldquo;get a moment to myself,&rdquo; and there
was always an accumulation of things to be done, or read, or
thought over, when a vacant half-hour could be had.&nbsp; The man
who will feel true loneliness, is he who has one sailor with him,
or a &ldquo;pleasant companion&rdquo; soon pumped dry; for he has
isolation without freedom all day (and night too), and a tight
cramp on the mind.&nbsp; With a dozen kindred spirits in a yacht,
indeed, it is another matter; then you have freedom and company,
and (if you are not the owner) you are not slaves of the skipper,
but still you are <i>sailed</i> and <i>carried</i>, as passive
travellers, and perhaps after all you had better be in a big
steamer at once&mdash;the Cunard&rsquo;s or the P. and O., with a
hundred passengers&mdash;real life and endless variety.&nbsp;
However, each man to his taste; it is not easy to judge for
others, but let us hope, that after listening to this log of a
voyage alone, you will not call it &ldquo;lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rob Roy is a yawl-rig, so as to place the sailor between
the sails for &ldquo;handiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is
double-skinned to make her staunch and dry <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>below, and she
is full-decked to keep out the sea above.&nbsp; She has an iron
keel and kelson to resist a bump on rocks, and with four
water-tight compartments to limit its effects if once stove
in.&nbsp; Her cabin is comfortable to sleep in, but only as
arranged when anchored for the purpose:&mdash;sleep at sea is
forbidden to her crew.&nbsp; Her internal arrangements for
cooking, reading, writing, provisions, stores, and cargo, are
quite different from those of any other yacht; all of them are
specially devised, and all well done; and now on the 7th of June,
at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, she is hastily launched,
her ton and a half of pig-iron is put on board for ballast, the
luggage and luxuries for a three months&rsquo; voyage are loaded
in, her masts are stepped, the sails are bent, the flags unfold
to the breeze, the line to shore is slipped, and we are sailing
from Woolwich, never to have any person aboard in her progress
but the captain, until she returns to the builders&rsquo;
yard.</p>

<p>Often as a boy I had thought of the pleasure of being
one&rsquo;s own master in one&rsquo;s own boat; but the reality
far exceeded the imagination of it, and it was not a transient
pleasure.&nbsp; Next day it was stronger, and so to the end,
until at last, only duty forced me reluctantly from my floating
freehold to another home founded on London clay, sternly
immovable, and with the quarter&rsquo;s rent to pay.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>At Erith then the Royal Canoe Club held its first sailing
match, when five little paddling craft set up their bamboo masts
and pure white sails, and scudded along in a rattling breeze, and
twice crossed the Thames.&nbsp; They were so closely matched that
the winner was only by a few seconds first.&nbsp; Then a Club
dinner toasted the prizemen, and &ldquo;farewell,&rdquo;
&ldquo;bon voyage&rdquo; to the captain, who retired on board for
the first sleep in his yawl.</p>
<p>The Sunday service on board the Training-ship
&lsquo;Worcester,&rsquo; at Erith, is a sight to see and to
remember.&nbsp; The bell rings and boats arrive, some of them
with ladies.&nbsp; Here in the &rsquo;tween decks, with airy
ports open, and glancing water seen through them, are 100
fresh-cheeked manly boys, the future captains of Taepings and
Ariels, and as fine specimens of the gentleman sailor-lad as any
Englishman would wish to see.&nbsp; Such neatness and order
without nonsense or prim awe.&nbsp; Health and brightness of
boyhood, with seamen&rsquo;s smartness and silence: I hope they
do not get too much trigonometry.&nbsp; However, for the past
week they have been skurrying up aloft &ldquo;to learn the
ropes,&rdquo; skylarking among the rigging for play, and rowing
and cricketing to expand muscle and limb; and now on the day of
rest they sing beautifully to the well-played harmonium, then
quietly listen to the clergyman of the &ldquo;Thames
Mission,&rdquo; <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>who has been rowed down here from his
floating church, anchored then in another bay of his liquid
parish, but now removed entirely.</p>
<p>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution had most kindly
presented to the Rob Roy one of its best lifeboat
compasses.&nbsp; The card of this compass floats in a mixture of
spirits, so as to steady its oscillations in a boat, and a
deft-like lamp alongside will light it up for use by night.&nbsp;
Only a sailor knows the peculiar feeling of regard and mystery
with which the compass of his craft becomes invested, the
companion in past or unknown future perils, his trusty guide over
the wide waste of waters and through the night&rsquo;s long
blackness.</p>
<p>Having so much iron on board, and so near this wondrous
delicate needle, I determined to have the boat
&ldquo;swung&rdquo; at Greenhithe, where the slack tide allows
the largest vessels conveniently to adjust their compasses.&nbsp;
This operation consumed a whole day, and a day sufficed for the
Russian steamer alongside; but then the time was well
bestowed,&mdash;it was as important to me to steer the Rob Roy
straight as it could be to any Muscovite that he should sail
rightly in his ship of unpronounceable name. <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>While the compass was thus made perfect for use at one
end of the boat, her anchors occupied my attention at the
other.</p>
<p>It was necessary to carry an anchor heavy enough to hold well
in strong tides, in bad weather, and through the long nights, so
that I could sleep then without anxiety.&nbsp; On the other hand,
the anchor must be also light enough to be weighed and stowed by
one man, and this too in that precious twenty seconds of time,
when in weighing anchor, the boat, already loosed from the ground
but not yet got hold of by the sails, is swept bodily away by the
tide, and faces look <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>cross from yachts around, being sure
you will collide, as a lubber is bound to do.</p>
<p>After considering the matter of anchors a long time, and
poising too the various opinions of numerous advisers, the Rob
Roy was fitted with a 50-lb. galvanized Trotman anchor and 30
fathoms of chain, and also with a 20-lb. Trotman and a hemp
cable.</p>
<p>The operation of anchoring in a new place and that of weighing
anchor are certainly among the most testing and risky in a voyage
like this, where the circumstances are quite new on each
occasion, and where all has to be done by one man.</p>
<p>You sail into a port where in less than a minute you must
apprehend by one panoramic glance the positions of twenty
vessels, the run of the tide, and set of the wind, and depth of
the water; and this not only as these are then existing, but in
imagination, how they will be six hours hence, when the wind has
veered, the tide has changed, and the vessels have swung round,
or will need room to move away, or new ones will have
arrived.</p>
<p>These being the <i>data</i>, you have instantly to fix on a
spot where there will be water enough to float your craft all
night, and yet not so deep as to give extra work next morning; a
berth, too, which you can reach as at present sailing, and from
which you can start again to-morrow; one where <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>there are no
moorings of absent vessels to foul your anchor, and where the
wind will not blow right into your sleeping cabin when the
moonlight chills, and where the dust will not blind you from this
lime barge, or the blacks begrime you from that coal brig as you
spread the yellow butter on your morning tartine.</p>
<p>The interest felt in doing this feat well is increased by
seeing how watchfully those who are already berthed will eye the
stranger, often speaking by their looks, and always feeling
&ldquo;hope he won&rsquo;t come too near <i>me</i>;&rdquo; while
the penalty on failure in the proceeding is heavy and sharp, a
smash of your spars, a hole in your side, or a sleepless night,
or an hour of cable-clearing to-morrow, or all of them; and
certainly in addition, the objurgations of every yachtsman within
the threatened circle.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the most unpleasant result of bad management is to
have damaged any other man&rsquo;s boat; and I cannot but mention
with the greatest satisfaction, that after so often working my
anchors&mdash;at least two hundred times&mdash;and so many days
of sailing in crowded ports and rivers, on no one occasion did
the Rob Roy even brush the paint off any other vessel.</p>
<p>Not far from my yawl there was moored a fine old frigate,
useless now for war, but invaluable <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>for
peace&mdash;the &ldquo;&lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; Training-ship for
homeless boys of London.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is for a class of lads
utterly different from those on the &lsquo;Worcester,&rsquo; but
they are English boys still, and every Englishman ought to do
something for English boys, if he cares for the present or the
future of England.</p>
<p>Pale and squalid, thin, heartless, and homeless, they were;
but now, ruddy in the river breeze, neat and clean, alert with
energy, happy in their wooden home, with a kind captain and smart
officers to teach them, life and stir around, fair prospects
ahead, and a British seaman&rsquo;s honest livelihood to be
earned instead of the miserable puling beggardom of the streets,
or the horrid company of the prison cell; which, that they should
lie in the path of any child of our land, adrift on the rough
tide of time at ten years old, is a glaring shame to the millions
of sovereigns in bankers&rsquo; books, and we shall have to
answer heavily if we let it be thus still longer. <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<p>The burgee flag of the Canoe Club flew always (white with our
paddle across &#390; C in cipher) and another white flag on the
mizen-mast had the <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>yawl&rsquo;s name inscribed.&nbsp;
Six other gay colours were used as occasion required.&nbsp; These
all being hoisted on a fine bright day, and my voyage really
begun, the &lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; lads &lsquo;boyed&rsquo; the
rigging, and gave three ringing cheers as they shouted,
&ldquo;Take these to France, sir!&rdquo; and the frigate dipped
her ensign in salute, my flag lieutenant smartly responding to
the compliment as we bade &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Thames to seaward looks different to me every time I float
on its noble flood.&nbsp; I have seen it from on board steamers
large and small, from an Indiaman&rsquo;s deck, the gunwale of a
cutter, and the poop of an ironclad, as well as from rowboat and
canoe, and have penetrated almost every nook and cranny on the
water, some of them a dozen times, yet always it is new to
see.</p>
<p>Thames river life is a separate world from the land life in
houses.&nbsp; The day begins on the water full an hour before
sunrise.&nbsp; Cheery voices and hearty faces greet you, and
there seems to be no maimed, or sick, or poor.&nbsp; From the
simple fact that you are on the river, there is a brotherhood
with every sailor.&nbsp; The <i>mode</i> is supple as the water,
not like the stiff fashion of the land.&nbsp; Ships and shipmen
soon become the &ldquo;people.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other folks on
shore are, to be sure, pretty numerous, but then they are
ashore.&nbsp; Undoubtedly <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>they are
useful to provide for us who are afloat the butter, eggs, and
bread they do certainly produce; and we gaze pleasantly on their
grassy lawns and bushy trees, and can hear the lark singing on
high, and peacocks screaming, and all are very pretty, and we are
bound to try to sympathize with people thus pinned to the soil,
while we are free in the fine fresh breeze, and glide on the
bounding wave.&nbsp; <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;These very people are all
the while regarding <i>us</i> with humane pity, as the
&ldquo;poor fellows in that little ship there, cabined, cribbed,
confined.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps it is well for all of us that the
stand-point of each, be it ever so bleak, becomes to him the
centre of creation.</p>
<p>As the country lane has charms for the botanist which will
sadly delay one in a summer stroll with such a companion, so to
the nautical mind every reach on a full river has a constant flow
of incidents quite unnoticed by the landsmen.&nbsp; In the crowd
of ships around us, no two are quite the same even to look at,
nor are they doing the same thing, and there are hundreds
passing.&nbsp; What a feast for the eye that hath an
appetite!&nbsp; The clink of an anchor-chain, the
&ldquo;Yo-ho!&rdquo; of a well-timed crew, the flapping of huge
sails&mdash;I love all these sounds, yes, even the shrill squeal
of a pulley thrills my ear with pleasure, and grateful to my
nostrils is the odour of tar.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Meanwhile we are sailing on to Sheerness; and no wonder
that the Rob Roy fixes many a sailor&rsquo;s eye, for the bright
sun shines on her new white sails, and her brilliant-coloured
flags flutter gladly in the wind as the waves glance and play
about her polished mahogany sides, the last and least addition to
the yacht fleet of England.</p>
<p>Rounding Garrison Point, at the mouth of the Medway, our
anchor is dropped alongside the yacht &lsquo;Whisper,&rsquo;
where the kind hospitality to the Rob Roy from English, French,
and Belgian, at once began, and it ceased only at the end of my
voyage.</p>
<p>After our tea and strawberries, and ladies&rsquo; chat
(pleasant ashore and ten times more afloat), the
blue-jackets&rsquo; band on board the Guard-ship gives music, and
the moon gives light, and around are the huge old war-hulks,
beautiful, though bygone, and all at rest, with a newer, uglier
frigate, that has no poetry in her look, but could speak forth
loudly, no doubt, with a very heavy broadside, for her thundering
salute made all the windows shudder as she steamed in
gallantly.</p>
<p>The tide of visitors to my yawl began at Sheerness.&nbsp;
Among them I caught a boy and made him grease the mast.&nbsp; His
friends were so pleased with their visit, that when the Rob Roy
came there again months afterwards, they brought me a present
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>of fresh mussels, highly to be esteemed by those who
like to eat them&mdash;everybody does not; but then was it not
grateful to give them thus? and is not gratitude a precious and
rare gift to receive?</p>
<p>The internal arrangements of the Rob Roy yawl are certainly
peculiar, for they were designed for a unique purpose, and as
there is no description (at least that I can find) of a yacht
specially made for one-man voyages, and proved to be efficient
during so long a sail, it may be useful here to describe the
inside of the Rob Roy.&nbsp; Safety was the first point to be
attained, as we have already mentioned, and this was provided for
by her breadth of beam (seven feet), her strongly bolted iron
kelson, her water-tight compartments, and her double skin, the
outer one being of polished Honduras mahogany, and the inner of
yellow pine, with canvas between them; also by her strong, firm
deck, her undersized masts and sails, and her lifeboat
dingey.</p>
<p>Next we had to consider the capacity for comfort; not for the
sake of any luxurious ease which could be expected, but so as to
take proper means to preserve health, maintain good spirits, and
to economize the energy which would undoubtedly be largely taxed
in downright physical muscular work, and which now would be
liable any <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>day to yield if overwrought by
long-continued anxiety, wakefulness, and exertion.</p>
<p>For this purpose the actual labour bestowed upon maintaining
the outward forms of a (partially) civilized life must be a
minimum, and the action required in times of risk or danger must
be as little encumbered as possible; and as every arrangement
came frequently under review, and improvements were well
considered in meditative hours, and many were put in practice
during a stay at Cowes, where the very best workmen were at
command, it may not unreasonably be asserted that for a solitary
sailor&rsquo;s yacht the cabin of the Rob Roy is at least a very
good specimen of the most recent model, and perhaps the best that
has been devised as a basis for the next advance.</p>
<p>Although at present I have no radical improvements to suggest
upon the general plan, it is, of course, open to the refining
experience of others; and I do not apologize for speaking of the
fittings of a little boat as if they were mere trifles because it
held only <i>one</i> man, when they may in any degree be useful
to yachts of larger size, and thus to that noble fleet of roaming
craft which renew the nerve and energy of so many Englishmen by a
manly and healthful enterprise, opening a whole new element of
nature, and nursing a host of loyal seamen to defend our
shores.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>From the sketch given at p. 23, and one partly in
section at p. 41, it will be understood that the Rob Roy is fully
decked all over except an open well near the stern which is three
feet square, and about the same in depth; a strong combing
surrounds both the well and the main hatchway as a protection in
the sea. <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; This well or after compartment is
separated from the next compartment by a strong bulkhead, sloping
forward (p. 7) to give all the room possible for stretching
one&rsquo;s limbs and a change of posture, and also so as to form
a comfortable sloping back inside in the cabin, while it supports
a large soft pillow, the whole being used as a sofa to recline on
while <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>reading or writing, or finally being
converted into a bolster by lowering it when the crew is piped to
bed for the night, or at least such hours of it as the tide and
wind may allow for sleep.</p>
<p>Fronting the seat the binnacle hangs with its tender thrilling
compass inside, well protected by thick plate glass, and the
lamp, which is always ready to be lighted up should darkness need
it; for experience has showed me only too plainly that it will
not do to postpone any preparation for night, or wind, or hunger,
or shoal water, but that you should be always quite prepared for
them all.</p>
<p>Above the binnacle is the chart; that is to say, a rectangular
piece cut out from the larger sheet, and containing all that will
be sailed in a day.&nbsp; The other parts, too, of the chart
ought to be kept where they are accessible for ready
reference.</p>
<p>Rain or the dashing of a wave or two soon softens the paper of
the chart, and on one occasion it was so nearly melted away in
this manner in a rough sea that I had to learn its lines and
figures quickly off by heart, and trust to memory for the rest of
the day.</p>
<p>To prevent another time such an awkward state of things, I
made a frame with a glass front and movable back, and this
allowed each portion <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of the chart to be placed inside, and
to be well protected, an excellent arrangement when your hands
are as wet as all other things around, and the ordinary chart
would be soaked in five minutes.</p>
<p>The chart frame is also detachable from its place, as it is
sometimes necessary to hold it near a lamp at night so as to read
the soundings.&nbsp; To aid still further to decipher the chart
at night and in dull afternoons, there is a small mounted lens in
a leather loop alongside, which has often to be used.&nbsp; The
compass <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a> itself is so placed that you can see it
well while either sitting or standing up, or when lying at full
length on the deck, with the back against a pillow propped by the
mizen mast, the blight sun or moon overhead, and a turn or two of
the mainsheet cast about your body to keep the sleepy steersman
from rolling over into the water, as shown next page.</p>

</a></p>
<p>This somewhat effeminate but decidedly comfortable attitude in
which to keep one&rsquo;s watch on deck, was not invented until
farther on in the cruise; and it seems odd that I should so long
have continued to sit upright for hours together (wriggling <!--
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>only a little at the constraint) for many a fine day
before adopting for a change so obvious a posture, and thus
effectually postponing any sense of weariness even in sailing for
a whole day and night.&nbsp; Still it is only for light airs,
gentle waves, or in deep rivers, or with long runs on the same
tack, that the captain may do his duty while he lies on a
sofa.&nbsp; In fresh breezes and rolling seas, or in beating to
windward with frequent boards, such indulgence is soon cut short;
and indeed the muscles and energies of the sailor are so braced
up <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>by the lively motion and refreshing blasts when there is
plenty of wind, that no <i>ennui</i> can come; and there is quite
enough play of limb and change of position caused by the working
of the ship, while he soon learns by practice to steer by the
action of any part of his body from head to feet being in contact
with the tiller, that delicate and true sensorium of a boat to
which all feeling is conveyed.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would sit low and out of sight, but with a glance
now and then at the compass, while the tiller pressed against my
neck.&nbsp; At others I would lie prone on the hatchway with my
head upon both hands, and my elbows on the deck, and my foot on
the tiller; while, again, every day it was necessary to cook and
eat, all the time steering; the most difficult operation of all
being to eat a boiled egg comfortably under these conditions,
because there is the egg and the spoon, each in a hand, and the
salt and the bread, each liable to be capsized with a direful
result.</p>
<p>Uncovered and handy for instant use there lies a sharp axe at
the bottom of the well, by which any rope may be cut, and a blow
may be given to the forelock of an anchor or other refractory
point needing instant correction, and near this again is the
sounding lead, with its line wound on a stick like that of a
boy&rsquo;s kite.&nbsp; I soon found that much <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the best way
to tell the fathoms, especially at night, was to measure the line
as it was hauled in by opening my arms to the full stretch of one
fathom between my hands.</p>
<p>In two large leather pockets fixed in the well, were sundry
articles, such as a long knife, cords of various kinds, a foot
measure of ivory (best to read off at night), and a good
binocular glass by Steward in the Strand. <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a></p>
<p>Turning now to the left of the seat in the well, we open a
door about a foot square, hinged so as to fall downwards and thus
form a cook&rsquo;s &ldquo;dresser;&rdquo; and now the full
extent is visible of our kitchen range, at p. 41, or in nautical
tongue here is the caboose of the Rob Roy.</p>
<p>It is a zinc box with a frame holding a flat copper kettle, a
pan in which to heat the tin of preserved meat for our dinner
to-day, and the copper frying-pan in which three eggs will be
cooked <i>sur le pl&acirc;t</i> for our breakfast to-morrow.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>The invaluable Rob Roy lamp <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a> is below this frame,
and a spare lamp alongside&mdash;a fierce blast it has, and it
will be needed if there is bad weather, for then sometimes as a
heavy sea is coming the kitchen is hastily closed lest the waves
should invade it, but the lamp may still be heard roaring away
inside all the same.&nbsp; An iron enamelled plate and a duster
complete the furniture of our little scullery, all the rest of
the things we started with having been improved out of existence,
for simplicity is the heart of invention as brevity is the soul
of wit.</p>
<p>If we desire to get at the tubular wooden flag box that some
gay colours may deck our mast in entering a new harbour, this
will be found inside the space aft of the caboose; and again, by
reaching the arm still further into the hollow behind our seat,
it will grasp the <i>storm mizen</i>, a strongly made triangular
sail, to be used only in untoward hours, and for which we must
prepare by lowering the lug mizen, and shifting the halyard,
tack, and sheet.&nbsp; Then the Rob Roy, with her mainsail and
jib reefed, will be under snug canvas, as seen at page 57.</p>
<p>But now it is bed-time, and the lecture on the furniture of
the yawl may be finished some other day.</p>

<p>Sheerness is on the whole a tolerable port to land at, that
is, as long as you refrain from going ashore.&nbsp; The harbour
is interesting and more lively than it appears at first sight,
but the streets and shops are just the reverse.</p>
<p>The Rob Roy ran into this harbour seven or eight times during
her cruise, and there was always &ldquo;something going
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; The anchorage on the south of the pier is in mud
of deep black colour, but not such good holding ground as it
would seem to be, and then what comes up on the anchor runs like
black paint upon your deck, and needs a good scrubbing to get rid
of it from each palm of the anchor.&nbsp; Even after all seems to
be cleared away thoroughly, there may be a piece <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>only
the size of a nut, but perverse enough to fasten upon the white
creamy folds of your jib newly washed out, and then the inky
stain will be an eyesore for days, until, for peace of mind, the
sail must be scrubbed again.&nbsp; Trifles these are to the
yachtsman who can leave all that to his crew, who sees only
<i>results</i>, but when the captain alone is the crew, the
realities of sea life must be endured as well as enjoyed, and yet
surely he is the one to enjoy most keenly the luxury of a white
spotless sail whose own hands have made it so.</p>
<p>If any sailor henceforth has me for his captain, and he has to
&ldquo;tidy up&rdquo; my yacht, he may be sure of having a very
considerate if not indulgent master&mdash;&ldquo;Governor,&rdquo;
of course, I mean, for there are no &ldquo;masters&rdquo; any
longer now, they are all promoted to the rank of
&ldquo;Governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the reason I should be considerate is that until you do it
all yourself you cannot have any idea of the innumerable
<i>minuti&aelig;</i> to be attended to in the proper care of a
yacht.&nbsp; Mine, indeed, was in miniature; but the number of
little things was still great, though each little thing was more
little.&nbsp; On the whole we should say that a yacht&rsquo;s
crew, even in port, have full employment for all their working
hours if the hull, spars, sails, ropes, and boats, besides the
cabin and stores, are always kept in that condition of order,
neatness, cleanliness, <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>readiness, and repair which ought to
be little short of perfection when regarded with a critical
eye.</p>
<p>In like manner as you drive out in a carriage and return, and
the carriage and horses disappear into the stables for hours of
careful work by the men who are there, so may the day&rsquo;s
sail in a yacht involve a whole series of operations on board
afterwards.&nbsp; Inattention to these in the extreme can be
observed in the boats of fishermen, and attention in the extreme
in the perfect vessels of the Royal Squadron; but even a very
reasonable amount of smartness requires a large expenditure of
labour which will not be effectual if it be hurried, and which
is, of course, worse than useless if it is done by inferior
hands.</p>
<p>In perfect trim and &ldquo;ship shape&rdquo; now, we loosed
from Sheerness, to continue the sail eastwards, and with a
leading breeze and a lovely morning.&nbsp; This part of the
Thames is about the best conjunction of river and sea one could
find, with land easily sighted on both sides, yet fine salt
waves, porpoises, and other attributes of the sea, and buoys, and
beacons, and light-ships to be attended to, and a definite line
of course determined on and followed by compass.&nbsp; A gale
here is not to be trifled with, though in fine weather you may
pass it safely in a mere cockle-shell, and the last <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>time
I had sailed here alone it was in an open boat, just ten feet
long inside.&nbsp; Still the whole day may be summed up now, as
it was in the log of the Rob Roy, &ldquo;Fine run to
Margate;&rdquo; the pleasures of it were just the same as so
often afterwards were met, enjoyed, and thanked for, but which
might be tedious to relate even once.</p>
<p>The harbour here dries bare at low tide, and as seventeen
years had elapsed since we had sailed into it, this bad habit of
the harbour was forgotten, but more years than that may pass
before it will be forgotten again, for as evening came, and the
water ebbed, and I reclined unharnessed in the cabin, reading
intently, there suddenly came a rude bumping shove upwards as
from below, and then another&mdash;the Rob Roy had
grounded.&nbsp; Soon there was a swaying this way and that, as if
yet undecided, and at length a positive heel over to <i>that</i>;
the whole of my little world within being canted to half a right
angle, and a ridiculous distortion of every single thing in my
bedroom was the result.&nbsp; The humiliating sensation of being
aground on hard unromantic mud is tempered by the ludicrous
crooked appearance of the contents of your cabin and by the
absurd sensation of sleeping in a corner with everything askance
except the lamp flame, which, because it burns upright, looks
most awry <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of all, and incongruously flares on
the spout of the teapot in your pantry.</p>
<p>And why this <i>bouleversement</i> of all things?&nbsp;
Because I had omitted to bring a pair of &ldquo;legs&rdquo; with
me, for a boat cannot stand upright on shore without legs any
more than an animal.</p>
<p>Next time the Rob Roy came to Margate we made one powerful leg
for her by lashing the two oars to the iron shroud, and took
infinite pains to incline the boat over to that side so as to be
turned away from the wind and screened from the tide, and I
therefore weighted her down by placing the dingey and heavy
anchor on the lee gunwale, and then with misplaced contentment
proceeded to cook my dinner.&nbsp; At a solemn pause in the
repast, the yawl, without other warning than a loud splash,
perversely turned over to the <i>wrong</i> side, with deck to sea
and wind, and every single thing exactly the contrary of what was
proper.&nbsp; I had just time to plunge my hissing spirit-lamp
into the sea, and thus to prevent the cry of &ldquo;Ship on
fire!&rdquo; but had not time to put out my cabin-lamp, and this
instantly bore its flame provokingly upright against the thick
glass of the aneroid barometer, which duly told its fate by three
sonorous &ldquo;crinks,&rdquo; and at once three starred cracks
shot through its crystal front.</p>
<p>The former experience of the night as spent <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>when one is
thus arbitrarily &ldquo;inclined to sleep&rdquo; made me wish to
get ashore; but this idea was stifled partly by pride and partly
by the fact that there was not water enough to enable me to go
ashore in a boat, and yet there was too much water besides soft
mud to make it at all pleasant to set off and wade to bed.&nbsp;
The recovery from this unwholesome state of things, with all the
world askew, was equally notable, for when the tide rose again,
in the late midnight hours, the sea-dreams of disturbed slumber
were arrested by a gentle nudge, and then by a more decided
heaving up of one&rsquo;s bed in the dark, until at last it came
level again as the boat floated, and all the things that were
right when she was wrong turned over now at wrong angles, because
the boat had righted. <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a></p>
<p>An excellent cure for all such little mishaps is to
&ldquo;imagine it is to-morrow morning,&rdquo; for in the morning
one is sure to forget all the night&rsquo;s troubles; and so with
the fiery rising sun on the sails we are floating out to sea.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>In such a sunny day the North Foreland is a very
comfortable-looking cliff, with pleasant country-houses on the
top, and corn-fields growing round the lighthouse.&nbsp; Next
there is Ramsgate, and then Dover pier.&nbsp; But now, and in
weather like this, will be a proper occasion to practise
man&oelig;uvres which will certainly have to be performed in bad
times, so we stretched away out to the Goodwin Sands, where one
is nearly always sure to find a sea running, and for several
hours we worked assiduously at reefing the sails, and getting the
little dingey out of the cabin and into the water, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>At least a short trial of my yacht in the Thames would have
been advisable before starting on a long voyage, but as this was
not possible now, it was of invaluable benefit to spend an
afternoon at drill on the Goodwin; rightly assured that success
in this journey could not be expected haphazard, but might be
hoped for after the <i>practice in daylight and fine weather of
what had to be done afterwards in rough water and
darkness</i>.&nbsp; By this time, just a week in the Rob Roy, the
little craft seemed quite an old friend.&nbsp; Her many virtues
and her few faults were being found out.&nbsp; The happy life
aboard had almost enchained me, but still I left the yawl at
Dover, and ran up to London for the annual inspection of the
London <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Scottish Volunteers; and having led
his fine company of kilted Riflemen through Hyde Park, the
Captain sheathed his claymore to handle the tiller again, eager
for the voyage.</p>
<p>The new rough hairy ropes had chafed my hands abundantly, and
they were red and black, and blistered, and swollen, and
variously adorned by cuts, and bruises, and scars.&nbsp; When
shall I ever get gloves on again, or be fit to appear at a
dinner-table?&nbsp; These wounds, however, had taught me this
lesson, &ldquo;Do every act deliberately.&nbsp; Hasty smartness
is slowest.&nbsp; When each single thing from morning to night
has to be done by your own fingers, save them from bruises and
chafes.&nbsp; Nothing is worse spent than needless muscular
action.&nbsp; You will want every atom you have some day or other
this week.&nbsp; Husband vital force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sappho schooner was at Dover, and her owner, Mr. Lawton,
one of the Canoe Club, took leave of the Rob Roy, and sailed away
to Iceland, while I started for Boulogne in the dawn, when all
the scene around looked like a woodcut, pale and colourless, as I
cooked hot breakfast at five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Nothing
particular happened in this voyage across the Channel.&nbsp; It
was simply a very pleasant sail, in a very fine day, and in a
good little boat.&nbsp; The sight of both shores at once, when
you are in the widest part of a passage, deprives it immediately
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>of the romance and interest of being entirely out of
sight of land and ships, and all else but water, and so there is
absent that deeper stir of feeling which powerfully seized me in
the wider traverse afterwards from Havre to Cowes.</p>
<p>Indeed, when you know the under-water geography of the channel
near Dover, it is impossible not to feel that you are sailing
over shallow waves; for though they seem to be deep and grand
enough from Dover Castle or the Boulogne heights, the whole way
might almost be spanned by piers and arches, and if you wished to
walk over dry shod at the low spring-tide, you need only lay from
shore to shore a twenty miles&rsquo; slice of undulated ground
cut from the environs of London.&nbsp; The cellars of the houses
would be at the bottom of the sea, but the chimney-pots would
still be above it for stepping-stones.</p>
<p>The wind fell as we neared France, and a fog came on, and the
tide carried us off in a wrong direction north to Cape Grisnez,
where I anchored with twenty fathoms, to wait for the reflux six
or seven hours.&nbsp; Often as we had to do the same thing in
after days, there was always constant employment for every hour
of a long stoppage like this, with a well-furnished tool-box, and
a busy mind ever making additions, experiments, improvements, and
with books to read.&nbsp; Not one <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>single moment
of the voyage ever hung heavy on the Rob Roy.</p>
<p>Trying to get into Boulogne at low water was an unprepared
attempt, and met its due reward; for the thing had to be done
without the benefit of my &ldquo;Pilot-book,&rdquo; which had
been put away with such exceeding care, that now it could not
anywhere be found&mdash;not after several rigorous searches all
over the boat.&nbsp; Finally, concluding that I must have taken
the book to London by mistake, we had to trust to nature&rsquo;s
light and go ahead.&nbsp; This does well enough for a canoe, but
not for the sailing-boat, which, if once aground, and with a sea
running, it would be utterly out of the power of one man to save.
<a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<p>In encountering the first roller off the pier at Boulogne, she
thumped the ground heavily.&nbsp; At the second, again, the masts
quivered, and all the bottles rattled in my cellar.&nbsp; Instant
decision turned her round from the third roller, and so after
bumping the ground twice again in the retreat, we put out to sea,
anchored, and got out the dingey, half-ashamed to be discomfited
thus at the very first French port.&nbsp; After an hour or two
spent in the dark, carefully sounding to discover <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>the
proper channel, and to get it well into my head, the anchor was
weighed, and we entered in a poor sort of triumph upon midnight,
slowly ascending the long harbour, but looking in vain for a
proper berth.&nbsp; All was quiet, every one seemed to be in bed,
until I came to the sluices at the end, which just then opened,
and the rush of foaming water from these bore me back again in
the most helpless plight, until I anchored near the well-known
&ldquo;Etablissement,&rdquo; furled sails, rigged up hatch, and
soon dropped fast asleep.</p>
<p>Now there is a peculiarity of the French ports which we may
mention here for once for all, but it applies to every one of
them, and has to be seriously considered in all your calculations
as a sailing-master.</p>
<p>They are quiet enough up to a certain time of night, but as
the tide serves, the whole port awakes, all the fishing vessels
get ready to start.&nbsp; The quays become vocal with shouts,
yells, calls, whistles, and the most stupid din and hubbub
confounds the night, utterly destructive of sleep.&nbsp; This
chorus was in full cry about two o&rsquo;clock <span
class="smcap">a.m.</span>&nbsp; Soon great luggers came splashing
along with shrieks from the crews, and sails flapping, chains
rattling, spars knocking about, as if a tempest were in
rage.&nbsp; Several of these lubberly craft smashed against the
pier, and the men screamed <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>more wildly,
and at length one larger and more inebriated than all the rest,
dashed in among the small boats where the Rob Roy slept, and
swooping down on the poor little yawl, then wrapt in calm repose,
she heeled us over on our beam-ends, and after fastening her
clumsy, rusty anchor in my mizen shrouds (which were of iron, and
declined to snap), she bore me and my boat away far off,
ignominiously, stern foremost.</p>
<p>Certainly this was by no means a pleasant foretaste of what
might be expected in the numerous other ports we were to enter,
and, at any rate, that night&rsquo;s sleep was gone.&nbsp; But in
a voyage of this sort a night&rsquo;s sleep must be resigned
readily, and the loss is easily borne by trying to forget it,
which indeed you soon do when the sun rises, and a good cup of
tea has been quaffed, or, if that will not suffice, then
another.</p>
<p>Vigorous health is at the bottom of the enthusiastic enjoyment
of yachting; but in a common sailor&rsquo;s life sleep is not a
regular thing as we have it on shore, and perhaps that staid
glazy and sedate-looking eye, which a hard-worked seaman usually
has, is really caused by broken slumber.&nbsp; He is never
completely awake, but he is never entirely asleep.</p>
<p>Boulogne is a much more agreeable place to reside at than one
might suppose from merely <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>passing
through it.&nbsp; Once I spent a month there, and found plenty to
see and to do.&nbsp; Good walks, hotels, churches, and
swimming-baths; the river to row in, the reading-room to sit in,
the cliffs to climb, and the sands to see.</p>
<p>At Dover the dock-people had generously charged me
&ldquo;nil&rdquo; for dues.&nbsp; I had letters for France from
the highest authorities to pass the Rob Roy as an article entered
for the Paris &ldquo;Exhibition;&rdquo; and when the
<i>douane</i> and police functionaries came in proper state at
Boulogne to appraise her value, and to fill up the numerous
forms, certificates, schedules, and other columned documents, I
had hours of walking to perform, and most courteous and tedious
attention to endure, and then paid for sanitary dues, &ldquo;two
sous per ton,&rdquo; that was threepence.&nbsp; Finally, there
was this insurmountable difficulty, that though all my
ship&rsquo;s papers were <i>en r&egrave;gle</i>, they must be
signed &ldquo;by two persons on board,&rdquo; so I offered to
sign first as captain and then as cook.&nbsp; They never troubled
me again in any other port, probably thinking the boat too small
to have come from a foreign harbour.&nbsp; In France the law of
their paternal Government prevents any Frenchman from sailing
thus alone.</p>
<p>The sun warmed a fine fresh breeze from the N.E. as we coasted
from Boulogne, and to sail <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>with it was a
luxury all day.&nbsp; The first pleasure was the morning
ablution, either by a wholesale dip under the waves, or a more
particular toilette if the Rob Roy was then in full sail.</p>
<p>To effect this we push the hatch forward, and open the
interior of the boat.&nbsp; If the water we float on is clean
(whether it be salt or fresh) we dip the tin basin at once, but
if we are in a muddy river or doubtful harbour we must draw from
our zinc water tank, which holds water for one week.&nbsp; This
tank is concealed by the figure of the cook kneeling in the
opposite sketch, but it is next to my large portmanteau in the
lower shelf.</p>
<p>A large hole in the top of the tank allows it to be filled at
intervals through a tun-dish, while a long vulcanized tube
through the cork to the bottom has an end hanging over.&nbsp;
When I wish to draw water it is done by applying the mouth for a
moment with suction, and the clear stream then flows by syphon
action into a strong tin can of about eight inches cube, which
holds fresh water for one day.&nbsp; By means of this tube, the
end of which hangs within an inch or two of my face when in bed,
I can drink a cool draught at night without trouble or chance of
spilling a drop.&nbsp; On the tank top is soap, and also a clean
towel, which to-morrow will be degraded into a duster, and
&ldquo;relegated,&rdquo; the newspapers would say, <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>to
the kitchen, and from whence it will again be promoted backwards
over the bulkhead to the washing-bag.&nbsp; This, you see, is the
red-tape order of dealing with towels on board the Rob Roy.</p>

<p>On the left shelf of the cabin we find two boxes of japanned
tin each about eighteen inches by six inches wide, as shown in
the woodcut.&nbsp; Below the shelf is a portmanteau full of
clothes.&nbsp; One of the boxes holds &ldquo;Dressing,&rdquo;
another &ldquo;Reading and writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The aneroid
barometer, and my watch are seen suspended alongside.&nbsp; The
boxes on the other side, shown in section at a future page, are
marked &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eating,&rdquo; while the
pantry is beside them, with teapot, cup (saucer discarded), <!--
page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>and tumbler, and a tray holding knife and fork, spoons,
salt in a snuff-box (far the best cellar after trials of many),
pepper (coarse, or it is blown away), mustard, corkscrew, and
lever-knife for preserved meat tins, etc., etc. <a

<p>The north coast of France from Boulogne to Havre is well
lighted at night, but the navigation is dangerous on account of
the numerous shoals and the tortuous currents and tides.&nbsp;
For about the first half of the distance the shores are low, and
the water, even far out, is shallow.&nbsp; Afterwards the land
rises to huge red cliffs, rugged and steep sometimes for miles,
without any opening.</p>
<p>The real matter of importance, however, in coasting here is
the direction of the wind.&nbsp; Had it been unfavourable, that
is S.W., and with the fogs and sea which that wind brings, it
would have been a serious delay to me&mdash;perhaps, indeed, a
stopper on my voyage&mdash;seeing that I must sometimes enter a
port at night so as to sleep in peace, for that could scarcely be
pleasantly done if anchored ten miles from land, and with no one
awake to keep a look-out.&nbsp; Fortunately, we had good weather
on the worst parts of the French coast, and my stormy days were
yet to come.</p>

<p>After a wash and morning prayers the crew are piped to
breakfast, so we must now turn to the kitchen, which after
constant use some hundred times I cannot but feel is the most
successful &ldquo;hit&rdquo; in the whole equipment.</p>
<p>Much thought and many experiments were bestowed on this
subject, because, first, it was well known that the hard and
uneven strain of bone, muscle, and energy in a voyage of this
sort needs to be maintained by generous diet, that cold feeding
is a delusion after a few days of it, and that the whole affairs
would fail, or at any rate, enjoyment of the trip would cease,
unless the Rob Roy had a caboose, easy to work, speedy in result,
and capable of being used in <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>rain, wind,
and rough weather, and by night as well as by day.</p>
<p>Of course, all stoves with coal or coke, or similar fuel were
out of the question, being hard to light, dusty when lighted, and
dirty to clean.&nbsp; Various spirit lamps, Etnas, Magic stoves,
Soyers, and others, were examined and tried, and all were
defective in grand points.</p>
<p>The wickless lamp used by the Alpine climber who occupies the
responsible post of &ldquo;Cook of the Canoe Club,&rdquo; and
modified (after consulting Professor Tyndall), is less than three
inches each way, and it acts after the manner of a
blow-pipe.&nbsp; It was also adopted in the Abyssinian
expedition.&nbsp; In two minutes after lighting it pours forth a
vehement flame about a foot in height, which with a warming heat
boils two large cups full in my flat copper kettle in five
minutes, or a can of preserved meat in six minutes. <a
name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a></p>
<p>While the kettle is boiling we bring forward the box marked
&ldquo;Eating,&rdquo; take the loaf of bread out of its macintosh
swathing, prepare the egg pan with two eggs, the teapot, and put
sugar into the tea-cup, and a spoonful of preserved milk <!--
page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>(Amey&rsquo;s is most convenient, being in powder; but
Borden&rsquo;s, in a kind of paste, is most agreeable); lastly,
we overhaul the butter tin, a pot of marmalade or anchovies.</p>
<p>The healthful relish with which a plain hot breakfast of this
sort is consumed with the fresh air all round, and the sun
athwart the east, and the waves dancing while the boat sails
merrily all the time, is enhanced by the pleasure of steering and
buttering bread, and holding a hot egg and a tea-cup, all at
once.</p>
<p>Then, again, there is the satisfaction of doing all this
without giving needless trouble in cleaning up, for every whit of
that work, too, is to be yours.&nbsp; A crumb must not fall in
the boat, because you will have to stoop down afterwards and pick
it up, seeing that whatever happens, one thing is insisted
on&mdash;&ldquo;the Rob Roy shall be always smart and
clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the breakfast things are cleared away and put by, each
into its proper place, and a general &ldquo;mop up,&rdquo; has
effaced the scene from our deck, but we can still take a look
below and notice what is to be seen.</p>
<p>Some of the articles chiefly important in the well of our boat
have been already described, but only those on the left of the
steersman sitting.&nbsp; Now, turning to the right we find a
water-tight <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>door, like that on the opposite side,
to be opened by folding down, and it reveals to us, first the
&ldquo;Bread store,&rdquo; a fourpenny loaf wrapped in macintosh,
which makes the best of table cloths, as it may be laid on a wet
deck, and can be washed and dried again speedily; next there is a
butter keg (as in the coolest place), and a box of biscuits, and
a flask of rum&mdash;the &ldquo;Storm supply&rdquo;&mdash;only to
be drawn upon when things of air and sea are in such a state that
to open the main hatch would be questionable prudence.</p>
<p>Here are, also, ropes, blocks, and purchases, as well as a
&ldquo;fender,&rdquo; not to keep coals on the hearth, but to
keep the mahogany sides of the Rob Roy safe from the rude
jostlings of other craft coming alongside.&nbsp; Above these odds
and ends is the &ldquo;Spirit room,&rdquo; a strong reservoir
made of zinc, with a tap and screw plug and internal division not
to be rendered intelligible by mere description here, but of
important use, as from hence there is served out, two or three
times daily, the fuel which is to cook for the whole crew.&nbsp;
One gallon of the methylated spirits, costing four shillings and
sixpence, will suffice for this during six weeks.</p>
<p>Above the spirit room will be found a blue light to be used in
case of distress, and a box of candles, so that we may be enabled
to rig up the <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>mast-light if darkness comes, when it
will not do to open the cabin.&nbsp; This ship-light is therefore
carried here.&nbsp; It is an article of some importance, having
to be strong and substantial, easily suspended and taken down,
and one that can be trusted to show a good steady light for at
least eight hours, however roughly it may be tossed about when
you are fast asleep below, in the full confidence that nobody who
sees your mast-light will run his great iron bows over your
little mahogany bed-room.&nbsp; Yet I fear it does not do to
examine into the grounds for any such confidence.&nbsp; Many
vessels sail about in the dark without any lights whatever to
warn one of their approach, and not a few boats, even with proper
lights in them, are &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; run over and sunk
in the river Thames; while out at sea, and in dark drizzly rain
or fog, it is more than can be expected of human nature that a
&ldquo;look-out man&rdquo; should peer into the thick blackness
for an hour together, with the rain blinding him, and the spray
splash smarting his eyes, and when already he has looked for
fifty-nine minutes without anything whatever to see.&nbsp; It is
in that last minute, perhaps, that the poor little hatch-boat has
come near, with the old man and a boy, its scanty crew, both of
them nodding asleep after long watches, and their boat-light
swinging in the <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>swell.&nbsp; There is a splash, a
crash, and a spluttering, and the affair is over, and the dark is
only the dark again.&nbsp; Nobody on the steamer knows that
anything has occurred, and only the fishermen to-morrow on some
neighbouring bank will see a broken hull floating sideways, near
some tangled nets.</p>
<p>I fully believe that more care is taken for the lives of
others by sailors at sea than in most cases on land where equal
risks are run; but there are dangers on the waves, as well as on
the hills, the roads, and even in the streets, which no foresight
can anticipate, and no precaution can avert.</p>
<p>The principal danger of a coasting voyage, sailing alone, is
that of being run down, especially on the thickly traversed
English coast, and at night.</p>
<p>As for the important question concerning the &ldquo;rule of
the road&rdquo; at sea, which is every now and then raised,
discussed and then forgotten again after some collision on a
crowded river in open day has frightened us into a proper desire
to prevent such catastrophes, it appears to me that no rule
whatever could possibly be laid down for even general obedience
under such circumstances, without causing in its very observance
more collisions than it would avert, unless the traffic in the
river were to be virtually arrested.</p>
<p>On land the &ldquo;rule of the road&rdquo; is well enough <!--
page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>on a <i>road</i>, where vehicles are moving in one of
two directions, but how would it do if it were to be insisted
upon at the place where two streets cross?&nbsp; Now the Thames
and other populous rivers are at times as much blocked and
crowded by the craft that sail and steam on the water as the
crossing at Ludgate Hill is by vehicles at three o&rsquo;clock,
that is, considering fairly the relative sizes of the objects in
motion, and the width of the path they must take, their means of
stopping or steering, and, above all, the great additional forces
on the water which cannot be arrested&mdash;<i>wind</i> and
<i>tide</i>&mdash;moreover, at this London crossing the traffic
has to be regulated by policemen, not by a rule for the drivers,
but by an external arbitrary director.</p>
<p>The wonderful dexterity of the cabmen, carmen, and coachmen of
London is less wonderful than that of the men who guide the
barges, brigs, and steamers on the Thames, and it is perfectly
amazing that huge masses weighing thousands of tons, and
bristling with masts and spars, and rugged wheels projecting,
should be every day led over miles of water in dense crowds,
round crooked points, along narrow guts, and over hidden shoals
while gusts from above, and whirling eddies below are all
conspiring to confuse the clearest head, to baffle the strongest
arm and to huddle up the whole mass into a general wreck.</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Consider what would be the result in the Strand if no
pedestrian could stop his progress within three yards, but by
anchoring to a lamp-post, and even then swinging round with
force.&nbsp; Why, there would be scarcely a coal-heaver who would
not be whitened by collision with some baker&rsquo;s boy.&nbsp;
Ladies in full sail would be run down, and dandies would be sunk
by the dozen.</p>
<p>The fact is, that vessels on the wide sea are like travellers
on a broad plain and not on a road at all, and the two cases do
not admit of being dealt with by the same rule, and it is not
wonderful that there should be many collisions in the open sea
while there are so few in the Thames, the water street of the
world.&nbsp; We may learn some lessons from land for safe traffic
on water.&nbsp; The cabman who &ldquo;pulls up&rdquo; is sure to
signal first with his whip to the omnibus astern of him, and the
coachman who means to cross to the &ldquo;wrong side&rdquo; never
does so without a warning to those he is bearing down upon.&nbsp;
What is most wanted, then, on the open water, is some ready,
sure, and costless signal, to say, &ldquo;I am going <i>that</i>
way&rdquo; (right or left); for nearly all collisions at sea are
caused by one ship not being able to know what the other is going
to do. <a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>This is my thought on the matter after many thoughts and
some experience: meantime while we have ate, and talked and
thought, our yawl has slipped over six miles of sea, and we must
rouse up from a reverie to scan the changing picture.</p>
<p>Glance at the barometer&mdash;note the time.&nbsp; Trim the
sails, and bear away to that pretty fleet of fishing boats
bobbing up and down as they trail their nets, or the men gather
in the glittering fish, and munch their rude breakfasts,
tediously heated by smoky stoves, while they gaze on the
white-sailed stranger, and mumble among themselves as to what in
the world <i>he</i> can be.&nbsp; The sun mounts and the breeze
presses till we are at the bay of the Somme with its shifting
sands, its incomprehensible currents, and its low and treacherous
coast, buoyed and beaconed enough to puzzle you right into the
shoals.&nbsp; The yacht, with my friend S--- in her, bound for
Paris, has just been wrecked on that bank near
Cayeux&mdash;unpleasant news now&mdash;and there is St. Valery,
from whence King William the Conqueror sailed with his fleet for
England, as may be seen on the curious tapestry at Bayeux worked
by his Queen&rsquo;s <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>hands, and still almost as fresh as
then.&nbsp; I never saw a place appear so differently from sea
and from land as this strange port, so I ran in just to
reconnoitre, and spent some hours with chart, compass, lead-line,
and Pilot-book, trying my best, to make out the currents, but all
to no purpose except to conclude that a voyage along this coast
in bad weather would be madness, unless with a man to help.</p>
<p>But nearly all this part of the French coast is awkward ground
to be caught in, especially where there are shifting or sinking
sands, for if the vessel touches these, the tide stream instantly
sucks the sand from under one side, while it piles it up on the
other, and thus the hull is gradually worked in with a ridge on
such side, and cannot be slewed off, but is liable to be wrecked
forthwith.&nbsp; It was interesting to read here the account of
this coast given by my Pilot-book, which had at last been dug out
of its hiding-place.&nbsp; The reader need not peruse this
official statement, but to justify my remarks on the dangers it
is given below in a note. <a name="citation52"></a><a

dervish&mdash;Sailing consort&mdash;Poor little
boy!&mdash;Grateful presents&mdash;The dingey&rsquo;s
mission&mdash;Remedy&mdash;Rise and work.</p>
<p>The aneroid barometer in my cabin pointed to &ldquo;set
fair&rdquo; for many a day, and just, too, when we required it
most to be fine, that is along the French coast.&nbsp; Had the
Rob Roy encountered here the sort of weather she met with
afterwards on the south coast of England, we feel quite assured
she must have been wrecked ashore or driven out to sea for a
miserable time.</p>
<p>So it was best to keep moving on while fine weather lasted,
for there was no knowing when this might change, even with the
wind as now in the good N.E.&nbsp; The Pilot-book says, upon this
(and pray listen to so good an authority&mdash;my only one to
consult with), &ldquo;Gales from N. to N.E. are also violent, but
they usually last only from 24 to 36 hours, and the wind does not
shift as it <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>does with those from the
westward.&nbsp; They cause a heavy sea on the flood stream, and
during their continuance the French coast is covered with a white
fog, which has the appearance of smoke.&nbsp; This is also the
case with all easterly winds, which are sometimes of long
duration, and blow with great force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening, as a sort of practical comment on the text
above, there was sudden fall of the wind, and then a loud peal of
thunder.&nbsp; Alert in a moment, we noticed, far away in the
offing, the fishing boats dip their sails and reef them, so we
knew there would soon be a blow, and we resolved to reef, too,
and just in time.&nbsp; My life-belt, <a name="citation55"></a><a
href="#footnote55" class="citation">[55]</a> therefore, <!-- page
56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>was
at once strapped on, and two reefs put in the mainsail, and one
in the jib, and the storm mizen was set, all in regular order,
when up sprung a fine west breeze, just as we were opposite
Treport, a pretty little bathing town under some cliffs, where my
night-quarters were to be.</p>
<p>The book already referred to gave a rather serious account of
the difficulties of entering Treport, its shingle bar, and the
high seas on it, and the cross tide and exceedingly narrow
entrance; but in an hour more the Rob Roy had come close to all
these things, and rose and fell on the rollers chasing each other
ashore.</p>
<p>The points to be kept in line for entering the harbour were
all clearly set forth in the book, and the signals on the pier
were all faultlessly given, while a crowd gradually collected to
see the little boat run in, or be smashed, and it was rather
exciting to feel that one bump on the bar with such a sea,
and&mdash;in two minutes the yawl would be a helpless wreck.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Among the spectators, the only one who did not hold his hat on
against the wind, was an extraordinary personage who capered
about shouting.&nbsp; Long curly hair waved over his face; his
dress was hung round with corks and tassels; he swung a long
life-line round his head, and screamed at me words which were of
course utterly lost in the <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>breeze.&nbsp;
This dancing dervish was the &ldquo;life saver,&rdquo; marine
preserver, and general bore of the occasion, and he seemed unduly
annoyed to see me profoundly deaf to his noise as I stood on the
after-deck to get a wider view, holding on by the mizen-mast,
steeling with my feet, and surveying the entrance with my
glass.&nbsp; All the people ran alongside as the Rob Roy glided
past the pier and smoothly berthed upon a great mud bank exactly
as desired, and then I apologized to the quaint Frenchman, saying
that I could not answer him before, for really I had enough to do
to steer <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>my boat, at which all the rest
laughed heartily&mdash;but we made it up next day, and the
dervish and Rob Roy were good friends again.</p>
<p>Here we found the &lsquo;Onyx,&rsquo; an English-built yacht,
but owned by M. Charles, one of the few Frenchmen to be found who
really seems to <i>like</i> yachting; plenty of them
<i>affect</i> it.</p>
<p>He was enthusiastic in his hospitality, and I rested there
next day, meeting also an interesting youth, an eager sailor, but
who took sea trips for his health, and drove from some Royal
Ch&acirc;teau to embark and freshen the colour in his delicate
face, so pale with languor.&nbsp; We could not but feel and
express a deep sympathy with one who loved the sea, but whose
pallid looks were in such contrast to the rough brown hue and
redundant health enjoyed so long by myself.</p>
<p>All was ataunt again, and then the two yachts started in
company for a run to Dieppe, which is only about thirteen miles
distant.&nbsp; We came upon a nest of twelve English yachts, all
in the basin of this port, so my French comrade spent the rest of
his time gazing at their beauty, their strength, their
cleanliness, and that unnamed quality which distinguishes English
yachts and English houses, a certain fitness for their special
purpose.&nbsp; These graceful creatures (is it possible that a
fine yacht can be counted as an inanimate <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>thing?)
reclined on the muddy bosom of the basin, but I would not put the
Rob Roy there, it seemed so pent up and torpid a life, and with
the curious always gazing down from the lofty quay right into
your cabin, especially as next day I wished to have a quiet
Sunday.</p>
<p>Instead of a peaceful day of rest the Sunday at Dieppe was
unusually bustling from morning to night, for it was the
&ldquo;F&ecirc;te Dieu&rdquo; there.&nbsp; The streets were
dressed in gala, and strewed with green herbs, while along the
shop fronts was a broad festooned stripe of white calico, set off
by roses here and there; the shipping, too, was decked in flag
array, and guns, bells, and trombones ushered a long procession
of schools and soldiers and young people coming from their
&ldquo;first communion,&rdquo; who with their priests, and
banners, and relics, halted round temporary altars in the open
air, to recite and chant, while a vast crowd followed to
gaze.</p>
<p>In a similar procession at St. Cloud, one division of the
moving host was of the tiniest little children, down to the
lowest age that could manage to toddle along with the hand of a
mother or sister to help, and the leader of them all was a chubby
little boy, with no head-gear in the hot sun but his curly hair,
and with his arms and body all bare, except where a lamb-skin
hung across.&nbsp; He <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>carried a blue cross, too, and the
pretty child looked bewildered enough.&nbsp; Some thought he was
John the Baptist, many more pronounced it a
&lsquo;<i>sottise</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the canoe voyages <a name="citation60"></a><a
href="#footnote60" class="citation">[60]</a> of the two preceding
summers, I had found much pleasure and interest in carrying a
supply of books, pictures, and periodicals, and illustrated
stories in various languages, which were given as occasion
admitted to all sorts of people, and everywhere accepted with
thanks, so that we could only regret the limit imposed on the
number to be carried in a canoe, where every ounce of weight
added to the muscular toil.</p>
<p>Relieved now from this restriction, the Rob Roy yawl was able
to load several boxes of this literary cargo, most of them kindly
granted for the special purpose of her voyage.</p>
<p>These presents were given away from day to day, and especially
on Sunday afternoons, among the sailors and water-population
wherever the Rob Roy roved.&nbsp; Thousands of seamen can read,
and have time, but no books.&nbsp; Bargees lolling <!-- page
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>about, or prone in the sun, eagerly began a
&lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rsquo; when thus presented, and
sometimes went on reading for hours.&nbsp; Fishermen came off in
boats to ask for them, policemen and soldiers, too, begged for a
book, and then asked for another for &lsquo;a child at
school.&rsquo;&nbsp; Smart yachtsmen were most grateful of all,
and some even offered to pay for them; the navvies, lock-keepers,
ferrymen, watermen, porters, dockmen, and guard-men of
lighthouses, piers, and hulks, as well as many a Royal Navy
blue-jacket, gratefully accepted these little souvenirs with
every appearance of gratitude.</p>
<p>The distribution of these was thus no labour, but a constant
pleasure to me.&nbsp; Permanent and positive good may have been
done by the reading of their contents; at any rate, they opened
up conversation, gave scope to courteous intercourse, often
leading to kinder interest.&nbsp; They opened to me many new
scenes of life, and some with darker passages and sorrowful
groups in the evident but untold background.&nbsp; They were, in
fact, the speediest possible introductions by which to meet at
once with large bodies of fellow-men too much unknown to us,
therefore forgotten, and then despised.&nbsp; The strata of
society are not to be all crushed into a pulpy mass, but a
wholesome mingling betimes does good, both to <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>the heavy
dregs below and to the &lsquo;cr&ecirc;me&rsquo; on the very
top.</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, we launch the little dingey on Sunday for
three or four hours&rsquo; rowing, and with a large leather bag
well filled at starting but empty on its return; and instead of
its contents we bring back in our memory a whole series of tales,
characters, and incidents of water-craft life, some tragic,
others comic, many &lsquo;hum-drum&rsquo; enough, but still
instructive, suggestive, branching out into hidden lives one
would like to draw forth, and telling sorrows that are softened
by being told.&nbsp; Of the French crews I began with here, not
one of the first few could even read, while five or six English
steamboats took books for all their men.&nbsp; On a preceding
Sunday (at Erith), I did not meet one man, even a bargee who
could not read, and all up the Seine only one in this
predicament.&nbsp; Truly there is a sea-mission yet to be
worked.&nbsp; Good news was told on the water long ago, and by
the Great Preacher from a boat.</p>
<p>And while thus giving these books and papers to others, it may
perhaps be allowed us also to add a few reflections suggested on
returning from the scenes and people we have sailed amongst
abroad.&nbsp; New scenes ought to be to the mind what fresh air
is to the body, reviving it for work <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>as well as
gladdening it with play; and perhaps one can do more for human
misery by withdrawing now and then from its close contact, than
by constant action in its midst.&nbsp; Yet it must be admitted
that the first impressions on one&rsquo;s return from such a long
vacation as the Rob Roy had are painfully acute.&nbsp; To come
back and read up in an hour the diary of the three months&rsquo;
work of our &ldquo;Boys&rsquo; Beadle&rdquo; (the agent employed
by the Reformatory Union to look after and attend to the
uncared-for street children), is to resume one&rsquo;s post of
contemplation of the dreadful picture of woe which crowds an
endless canvas with suffering figures, and each case delineated
in such a report means far more behind to the eye that can
realize.&nbsp; Again, to walk past St. George&rsquo;s Hospital
next day and observe the stream of visitors with anxious steps
going up the stairs, and those coming down with kind and
thoughtful looks, as they leave their dearest relatives, and
confidingly, in strangers&rsquo; hands, and to think what is up
there.&nbsp; To find in letters awaiting one&rsquo;s return the
gaps made by death in the circle of acquaintance.&nbsp; These are
salutary and sudden shocks to self-enjoyment of health and whole
limbs, and they are loud calls for more than a gush of sympathy
or a song of thankfulness, but for downright help by practical
work.&nbsp; Still greater was the change from bounding <!-- page
64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>along
in florid health on merry waves of the wholesome sea, to a walk
through the east end of London,&mdash;that morass of vice, and
sighs, and savagery,&mdash;what is forced on the senses in an
hour being not a hundredth of what is sunk below.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is well we do not always realize the amount of evil
around us, of bad, I mean, that can be made good by efforts, some
of which we are bound to make.&nbsp; If we knew how big the
mountain is we might despair of digging it down by spadefuls,
though the faith that digs is the one that can say with best
hopes for obedience, &ldquo;Be thou removed and cast into the
sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Few children would have courage to begin the
alphabet as a step to learning if they knew what a long and heavy
road is to be trudged beyond.</p>
<p>And it may be remarked that in returning to one&rsquo;s post
of duty after a time of &ldquo;leave,&rdquo; there is at first a
disposition rather to generalize about what ought to be done than
to set to work and do it.&nbsp; It is natural, indeed, that
before putting on the harness once more we should take a look at
the collar and buckles, and at the load to be drawn, and it may
be allowable to the soldier, while on his way to rejoin the
ranks, to take just a glance at the line of march before he falls
in.</p>
<p>Theorizing is soon cut short, however, by the <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>clamour of work waiting to be done, and the absorbing
interest felt in doing it, and perhaps too soon we forget all
doubts as to whether the direction of our labours is after all
the best, or whether time might not be saved by improving the
instruments of our work, the object of using them being still the
same.</p>
<p>Now there is a reflection suggested each time in frequent
foreign travel which lasts longest on my mind after returning to
England&mdash;&ldquo;How is it that our lowest classes seem to be
lower than the lowest abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether they are so or not is another question; but in all our
great towns there is a mass of human beings whose want, misery,
and filth are more patent to the eye, and blatant to the ear, and
pungent to the nostrils, than in almost any other towns in the
world.&nbsp; Their personal liberty is greater, too, than
anywhere else.&nbsp; Are these two facts related to each
other?&nbsp; Is the positive piggery of the lowest stratum of our
fellows part of the price we pay for glorious freedom as
guaranteed by our &ldquo;British Constitution&rdquo;? and do we
not pay very dearly then?&nbsp; Must the masses be frowsy to be
free?</p>
<p>The highest class of society can <i>enjoy</i> the benefits of
our mode of government, with their rank and wealth secured, and
<i>prestige</i> added.&nbsp; <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>In return
they surrender indeed the pleasure of downright tyranny and a
small quota of their ample gold.</p>
<p>The middle class also can <i>enjoy</i> their freedom from
oppression, and a nominal share in politics, and they pay by hard
work for this.</p>
<p>But the wretched beings at the bottom of all, muddled,
starved, and squalid, cannot <i>enjoy</i> freedom, and must not
have &ldquo;license.&rdquo;&nbsp; They seethe by thousands in
ignorance and foulness, and, with our &ldquo;British
Constitution&rdquo; standing by in all its glory, they rot and
perish, a multitude dark and unclean.</p>
<p>That all the luxury and congestion of wealth in the head of
the body corporate, while its lowest limbs are in rags and pallid
mortification, should be permitted by the head, blinded by
plethora, and peacefully endured by the limbs, dispirited by
inanition, is an astounding marvel.&nbsp; But there are twinges
of pain now and then.&nbsp; The very quiet is only that of
syncope, and any day it may be broken by a wild and furious
paroxysm.&nbsp; Unless the permission of this evil by the head
ceases, then the endurance of it by the limbs will cease.</p>
<p>If the rich are not mingled with the wretched, they are at
least entangled with them, and by knots that cannot be untied,
and will not be cut.&nbsp; The thief indeed, and the burglar, and
more lately <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the lazy vagabond, and now the
assassin, have <i>forced</i> us to consider them; and we even
attend to the drunkard, provided he pleads for notice by rolling
in our path.</p>
<p>Perhaps at last the wretched also will arrest us.</p>
<p>Is not the time come yet to rouse up head, and heart, and
hand, to do more than we have even attempted, and to raise at the
least the appearance of our lowest classes to the respectability
now attained in countries we are apt to despise?</p>
<p>What is the specific?&nbsp; I have no new one, and no new
reason for the old one, but it is easy enough to find tools to
work with in this field, if only we are persuaded that work has
to be done and we are willing to take our share.&nbsp; Numbers do
this, and nobly, but far too few, and much is done, but not half
enough.&nbsp; Thousands are yet idle here, who will not listen to
God or their conscience or even their instinct in the matter, who
live comfortably apart from the evil places, and so hear only now
and then a message from the dying wafted on the sable wings of
cholera or typhus.&nbsp; Is it not shabby this, to shirk their
share of the work and the trouble, and to leave it to be done by
softer hearts and a national purse?</p>
<p>It is these, who are moved neither by religion, nor humanity,
nor self-respect, that a downright <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>scolding may
perhaps stir up; and if we can show them that the state of our
lowest classes is a <i>national shame</i>, that we are beaten as
in a battle and distanced in a race, then they will soon find the
means by which national honour is to be retrieved.&nbsp;
Half-a-dozen Englishmen are in danger of death in Africa, and we
spend millions of money because they are Britons, and to sustain
the British name; but thousands of Britons are living in
wretchedness or dying in misery just far enough from our doors
not to be seen, and less heard of than if they were in
Zululand&mdash;to leave them as they now are is a scandalous
national disgrace which every true Englishman who knows the facts
is ashamed of and which, even if he ignores them at home, he is
forced to feel abroad by the taunts of strangers.</p>
<p>Already we wonder that we ever kept the Thames as a common
sewer; our sons will wonder, some day, that their fathers had a
great human sink in every great town reeking out crime, disease,
and disloyalty on the whole nation.&nbsp; I have seen the serfs
in Russia, the slaves in Africa, the Jews in Asia, and the
negroes in America; but there are crowds of people in England in
a far worse plight than these&mdash;their very nearness to light,
and happiness, and comfort, makes their misery more
disgraceful.</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>National honour may be a lower motive to work with than
love to Christ or love to man; but it moves more minds than
either of these, and on a scale large enough to relieve us from a
national disgrace which will cling to the nation until the nation
rises in shamed earnest to shake it off.</p>

<p>So much for Sunday thoughts; but after the day had ended,
there happened to me an absurd misery, of the kind considered to
be comical, and so beyond sympathy, but which must be told, and
it happened thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>The little yawl being anchored in the harbour had also a long
rope to the quay, and by this I could draw her near the foot of
an upright ladder of iron bars fixed in the stones of the quay
wall, an ordinary plan of access in such cases.&nbsp; The
pier-man promised faithfully to watch my boat as the tide sunk
(it was every moment more and more under his very nose), and so
to haul her about that she should not &ldquo;ground&rdquo; before
my return; yet, when I came back at night, her keel had sunk and
sunk until it reached the bottom, so <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>she could not
be moved with all our pulling.&nbsp; Moreover the tide had gone
out so far as to prevent any boat at all from coming to the dock
wall round the harbour.&nbsp; I tried to amuse myself for an hour
while the tide might rise; but at length, impatient and sleepy
and ready for bed, to be off to-morrow at break of day, I
determined to get on board at once somehow or other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p71b.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=

</a></p>
<p>Descending then by the iron bars until I reached the last of
them, I swung myself on the slack of the strong cable hanging
from above (and attached at the other end to my yawl), and which
the man received strict orders to &ldquo;haul taut&rdquo; at the
critical moment.&nbsp; Alas! in his clumsy hands the effect
intended was exactly reversed; the rope was gently loosened, and
I subsided in the most undignified, <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>inevitable,
and provokingly cool manner quietly into the water at 10.30 <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>&nbsp; However, there was no use in
grumbling, so I spluttered and laughed, and then went to bed.</p>
<p>Long before sunrise the Rob Roy was creeping out of the
harbour of Dieppe against the strong wind at that point dead
ahead; but I took the tow-line thrown down from the quay by some
sturdy fishwives, who will readily tug a boat to the pier head
for a franc or two, and thus save a good half-hour of tedious
rowing against wind and tide.&nbsp; This rope was of a deep black
colour, very fine, thin, and yet strong.&nbsp; There was no time
to find out what it was made of, but it seemed to be plaited of
human hair.&nbsp; As I was aft in my boat and steering, the line
suddenly slipped and disappeared, and the Rob Roy was in great
danger of going adrift on the other pier head, but the excellent
dames speedily regained their long black tress, and coiled it and
threw it to me again with great dexterity; and soon all was put
right, and the sails were up, and the line cast off, and we
plunged along in buoyant spirits.</p>
<p>It was a fair wind now, and with a long day in front, and the
freshness of Monday after a good rest.&nbsp; Still this was a
rather more anxious day than the others, because in those though
we had passed over the dangers on the coast of the <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Somme, they were hidden by water; and on a sunny morning
who can realize shoals that are so fatal in bad weather, but are
concealed by the smiling calm of a fine day?&nbsp; Not so with
the great beetling cliffs of sharp red flint now glittering
alongside my course for miles and miles far beyond what the eye
could reach.&nbsp; These formed an impressive object ever in
sight, and generally begetting, as it was seen, an earnest hope
that the weather might be good &ldquo;just to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This part of the coast, too, beside being iron-bound, has no port
that is easy to enter, and the tides moreover are very powerful,
so that, with either a gale or a calm, there would be a danger to
meet.</p>
<p>It is obvious, of course, to the sailor who reads this that
the difficulty of navigation along such a coast was much
increased by my being alone.&nbsp; An ordinary vessel would put
well out to sea, and go on night and day in deep water with a
good offing, and its crew would take watch and watch until they
neared the land again close to their destination.</p>
<p>But the course of the Rob Roy had to be within seven or eight
miles of the shore, so as to keep within reach of a port at
night, or at the worst near some shallower spot for anchorage;
else, in the attempt to sleep, I might have been drifted <!--
page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>twenty miles by the tide, perhaps out to sea, right away
from our course, and perhaps ashore on the rocks.&nbsp; It had
not yet become my plan to pass whole nights at sea as was
necessary in the latter part of this voyage.</p>
<p>With these little drawbacks now and then, which threw rather a
graver tone into the soliloquy of the lonely traveller, it was
still a time of excessive enjoyment.&nbsp; The noble rocks
towered up high on the left, and the endless water opened out
wide on the right with only some dot of a sail, hull down, far
far off on the horizon, a little lonely speck fixed in hard
exile; but very probably the crew in that vessel too were happy
in the breezy morn, and felt themselves and their craft to be the
very &ldquo;hub of the universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a nook of the cliffs was Etretat, now the most fashionable
bathing-place of Northern France.&nbsp; Long pointed pillars of
rock stood in the sea along this shore, one especially notable,
and called the &ldquo;Needle of Etretat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others were
like gates and windows, with the light shining through.&nbsp; I
thought of looking in here to escape the flood-tide which was
against me, but I was deterred by the Pilot-book telling in plain
words, &ldquo;The Eastern part of the beach at Etretat is
bordered by rocks which uncover at low water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rob Roy&rsquo;s previous behaviour in a sea made <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>me
quite at ease about waves or deep water, but to strike on a rock
would be a miserable delay, and somehow I became more cautious as
to exposing my little craft to danger the more experience I
acquired; certainly also she was valued more and more each
day.&nbsp; This increase together of experience and of
admiration, begetting boldness and caution by turns, went on
until it settled down into a strange compromise,&mdash;extreme
care in certain circumstances, and undue boldness at other
times.</p>
<p>All over the British Channel there are patches of sand,
shingle, or rock, which being deep down are not dangerous as
regards any risk of striking upon them, but still even without
any wind they cause the tide-stream to rush over them in great
eddies, and confused babbling waves.&nbsp; The water below is in
action, just like a waterfall tumbling over a hill, and the
whirlings and seethings above look threatening enough until you
become thoroughly aware of the exact state of the case, being
precisely that which occurs above Schaffhausen, on the deeps of
the Rhine, and which we have described in the account of a canoe
voyage there.</p>
<p>These places are called by the French
&ldquo;rid&egrave;ns,&rdquo; or in England &ldquo;ridges,&rdquo;
and in some charts, &ldquo;ripples&rdquo; or
&ldquo;overfalls,&rdquo; and while there is sure <!-- page
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>to be
a short choppy sea upon them, even in calm weather, the effect of
a gale is to make them boil and foam ferociously.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar feature is the result when a low bank
projects under water from a cape round which the tide is rushing;
and as I determined not to risk going into Etretat, we had to
face the tedious tossing about off one of these banks, described
thus in the Pilot-book:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abreast Etretat the shoal bottom, with less than eight
fathoms on it, projects a mile to the N.N.W. from the shore, and
when the flood-stream is at its greatest strength it occasions a
great eddy, named by the mariners of the coast the
<i>Hardi&egrave;res</i>, which extends to the northward as far as
the Vaudieu Rock, and makes the sea hollow and heavy when the
wind is fresh from the eastward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just because the wind was fresh from the eastward that
I could hope to stem the tide and get through this place; but
once in the middle of the hubbub, the wind went down almost to
nothing, so that for three or four hours I could only hold my
place at most, and the wearisome monotony here of &ldquo;up and
down&rdquo; on every wave, with a jerk of all my bones each time,
was one of the few dull and disagreeable things of the whole
voyage.</p>
<p>A sea that is &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; is abominable.&nbsp;
However <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>high a wave is, it may still have a
rounded and respectable shape, and it will then tilt you about
smoothly; but a &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; sea splashes and smacks and
twists and screws, and the tiring effects on the body, thus hit
right and left with sudden blows, is quite beyond what would be
anticipated from so trifling a cause.</p>
<p>At length, as the tide yielded, the wind carried me beyond the
Hardi&egrave;res, on and on to F&eacute;camp, where the Rob Roy
meant to stop for the night.&nbsp; But, willing though I was to
rest there, the appearance of F&eacute;camp from the offing was
by no means satisfactory.&nbsp; It did not look easy to get into,
and how was I to get out of it to-morrow?&nbsp; The Pilot-book
took a similar view of this matter. <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a></p>
<p>Yet we must put in somewhere, and this was the nearest port to
the Cape Antifer, the only remaining point to be anxious about,
and which we might now expect to round next day.&nbsp; On the
other hand, there was the argument, &ldquo;If the wind chops
round to the west, we may be detained in F&eacute;camp for a
week, whereas now it is favourable; and if we can possibly get
round to-day&mdash;Well <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>what a load of anxiety would be done
with if we could do that!&rdquo;&nbsp; The thought, quite new,
seemed charming, and, yet undecided, I thought it best to cook
dinner at once and put the question to the vote at dessert.</p>
<p>It is very puzzling what name to give to each successive meal
in a day when the first one has been eaten at 2 <span
class="smcap">a.m.</span>&nbsp; If this is to be considered as
<i>breakfast</i>, then the next, say at nine o&rsquo;clock, ought
to be luncheon, which seems absurd, though the Americans call any
supplemental feeding a &ldquo;lunch,&rdquo; even up to eleven
o&rsquo;clock at night, and you may see in New York signboards
announcing &ldquo;Lunch at 9 <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>&nbsp; Clam Chowder.&rdquo; <a
name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a></p>
<p>Now, as I had often to begin work by first frying at one or
two o&rsquo;clock in the moonlight, and as it would have a greedy
sound if the next attack on eatables were to be called
&ldquo;second breakfast,&rdquo; the only true way of settling
this point was to consider the first meal to be in fact a late
supper of yesterday, or at any rate to regard it as belonging to
the bygone, and therefore beyond inquiry, and so to ignore this
first breakfast altogether in one&rsquo;s arrangements.&nbsp; The
stomach quite approved of this decision, and was always ready for
the usual breakfast at six or <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>seven
o&rsquo;clock, whatever had been discussed a few hours
before.</p>
<p>The matter as to Etretat was decided then.&nbsp; We two were
to go on, and to hope the wind would do so to.&nbsp; Then away
sped we merrily singing, with the new and unexpected prospect of
possibly reaching Havre that very day.&nbsp; From thence a month
was to be passed in going up and down the Seine and at Paris; and
what was to come after that?&nbsp; How come back to
England?&nbsp; Why that problem must now be
&ldquo;blinked,&rdquo; as a future if not an insoluble question,
at any rate just as easy to solve a month hence as it is now.</p>
<p>For a long time the wind was favourable, and precisely as
strong as was desirable, and the formidable looking Cape Antifer,
which at mid-day seemed only a dark blue stripe on the distant
horizon, gradually neared us till we could see the foam eddying
round its weather-wasted base.&nbsp; Then came the steep high
wall of flint cliff with shingle d&eacute;bris at its foot, but
no one approach from top to bottom, if any bad thing
happened,&mdash;no, not for miles.</p>
<p>This was a time of alternate hope and fear, as the wind
gradually lulled away to nothing, and fog arose in the hot sun;
the waves were tossing the Rob Roy up and down, and flapping the
sails in an angry petulant way, very distressing if you <!-- page
80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>are
sleepy.&nbsp; For four hours this hapless state of things
continued, yet we were already within five miles of Cape de la
H&egrave;ve, and, once round that, on the other side was
Havre.&nbsp; How tantalizing to be so near, and yet still out of
reach!&nbsp; If this calm ends in a west wind, we may be driven
back anywhere by that and the tide.&nbsp; If it ends in a
thunderstorm we shall have to put off to sea at once.</p>
<p>See there the lighthouses up aloft on the crag&mdash;two of
them are lighted.&nbsp; Soon it will be dark around, and we shall
at this rate have to enter Havre by night.&nbsp; All this time we
were close to the cliffs, but the sounding-lead showed plenty of
water, and when the anchor was thrown out the cable did not pull
at all; we were not drifting but only rocked by the incessant
tumble and dash of the sea, which, though of all things glorious
when careering in the breeze, is of all most tiresome when
rolling in a calm.</p>
<p>At this time I felt lonely, exceedingly lonely and helpless,
also sleepy, feverish, discontented, and miserable.&nbsp; The
lonely feeling came only twice more in the voyage; the other bad
feelings never again.</p>
<p>Now, there are one or two sensations which after experience at
sea seldom deceive you as to what they prognosticate, though it
is impossible <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>to give reasons for their hold upon
the mind.&nbsp; One is the feeling, &ldquo;I am drifting,&rdquo;
another, &ldquo;The water is shoaling,&rdquo; and the third,
&ldquo;Here comes a breeze.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each of these may be
felt and recognised even with your eyes shut.&nbsp; It does not
come in through one sense or another, but it seems to grasp the
whole system; and it is a very great convenience to have this
faculty alive in these three directions, and to know when to
trust it as a true impression.</p>
<p>On the unmistakable sensation that a breeze was coming, the
rebound from inaction and grumbling, lying full-length on deck,
to alert excitement was instantaneous and most pleasing.&nbsp;
The anchor was rattled up in a minute, and it was scarcely stowed
away before the genial air arrived, with ripples curling under
its soft breath, once more exactly favourable.</p>
<p>Slowly the two lights above on the cliff seemed to wheel round
as we doubled the Cape.&nbsp; Slowly two little dots in the
distance swelled up into big vessels in full sail, and others
rose from the far-off waters, all converging to the same port
with myself; their very presence being companionship, and their
community of purpose begetting a mutual interest.&nbsp; For these
craft deep in the water the navigation here is rather intricate,
though the excellent and uniform system of buoys employed in
France does <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>all that is possible to make the
course clear; but my little boat, drawing less than three feet of
water, could run safely even over the shallows, though, as a
rule, I navigated her by the regular channels, as this gave me
much additional interest in the bearings about every port.</p>
<p>When the lights at Havre hove in sight the welcome flashing
was a happy reward to a long day&rsquo;s toil, and as the yawl
sped forward cheerily through the intervening gloom, the kettle
hummed over the lamp, and a bumper of hot grog was served out to
the crew.&nbsp; Soon we rounded into the harbour, quiet and calm,
with everybody asleep at that late hour; and it was some time
more before the Rob Roy could settle into a comfortable berth,
and her sails were all made up, and bed unrolled, and the weary
sailor was snoring in his blanket.</p>
<p>Next day the people on the quays were much amused by the
curious man&oelig;uvres of my little dingey; its minute size, its
novel form (generally pronounced to be like a half walnut-shell),
its bright colour, and the extraordinary gyrations and whirlings
which it could perform, for practice taught some new feat in it
almost every day.</p>
<p>At night there was a strange sound, shrill and loud, which
lasted for hours, and marred the calm eve and the quiet twinkling
of the stars.&nbsp; This <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>came from a
hundred children collected by a crackbrained stranger (said to be
English).&nbsp; These he gave cakes and toys to by day lavishly,
and assembled them at night on the quay to sing chorus to his
incoherent verses&mdash;a proceeding quite wonderful to be
permitted by the police so strict in France.</p>

<p>Havre was a good resting-place to receive and send letters,
read up the newspapers, get a long walk, and a hot bath, and
fresh water and provisions.&nbsp; Bacon I found, after many
trials to cook it, was a delusion, so I gave mine to a steamboat
in exchange for bread.&nbsp; Hung beef too was discovered to be a
snare&mdash;it took far too long to cook, and was tough after
all; so I presented a magnificent lump to a bargee, whose time
was less precious and his teeth more sharp.&nbsp; Then one mast
had to come down in preparation for the bridges on the Seine; and
therefore with these things to do, and working with tools and
pen, all the hours were busily employed until, at noon on June
26, I hooked on to a steamer, &lsquo;Porteur,&rsquo; <!-- page
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>with
its stern paddles very common in France, to be towed up the
river; a long and troublesome voyage of about 300 miles, so
winding is the course to Paris by the Seine.</p>
<p>This mode of progress was then new to me, and I had made but
imperfect preparations, so that when we rounded the pier to the
west, and met the short, snappish sea in the bay, every wave
clashed over me, and in ten minutes I was wet to the skin, while
a great deal of water entered the fore-compartment of the yawl
through the hole for the chain-cable at that time left open. <a
name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a>&nbsp; The surprising suddenness of this
drenching was so absurd that one could only laugh at it, nor was
there time to don my waterproof suit&mdash;the sou&rsquo;wester
from Norway ten years ago, the oilskin coat (better than
macintosh) from Denmark last year, and the canvas trowsers.</p>
<p>A good wetting can be calmly borne if it is dashed in by a
heavy sea in honest sailing, or is poured down upon you from a
black cloud above; but here it was in a mere river-mouth, and on
a sunny day, and there was no opportunity to change for several
hours, until we stopped at a village to discharge cargo.&nbsp;
The river at that place was narrow, and all the swell I thought
was past; so, <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>after a complete change of clothes,
it was too bad to find in a mile or two the same story over
again, and another wetting was the result.&nbsp; The evening rest
was far from comfortable with my bedding all moist, and both
suits of clothes wet through.&nbsp; One has therefore to beware
of the accompaniments of being towed.&nbsp; The boat has no time
to go over the waves, and, long rope or short, middle or side,
steering ever so well, the water shipped when a heavy boat is
swiftly towed must be as well prepared for as if it were in a
regular gale on open sea.</p>
<p>The Rob Roy had now in the hold a great deal of water, and for
the first time I had to apply the pump, which, having been
carefully fitted, acted well.&nbsp; An india-rubber tube leading
down to the keel was in such a position that I could immediately
screw on a copper barrel and work the piston with one hand, so as
to clear the stern compartment.&nbsp; By turning a screw valve I
could let the water come from the centre compartment, if any was
there, and then I went to the fore-compartment, about seven feet
long, which held the spare stores, and a curiosity in the shape
of a regulation chimney-pot hat to be worn on state occasions,
but which was brought out once a week merely to brush off the
green mould.</p>
<p>At noon the steamer set off again, dragging the <!-- page
87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>yawl
astern, and soon entered the first lock on the Seine, where the
buildings around us, the neat stone barriers, and the dress and
the very looks of the men forcibly recalled to my mind the
numerous river locks passed in my canoe trips, but in so
different a manner, by running the boat round every one of them
on the gravel or over the grass.</p>
<p>The waste of time now in passing through each lock was
prodigious.&nbsp; While nearing it the steamer sounded her shrill
whistle to give warning, but still the lock was sure to be full
of barges and boats.&nbsp; Then our cavalcade had to draw aside
until the sluggish barges in front had all come out, and we went
into the great basin with bumps, and knocks, and jars, and
shouting.&nbsp; It required active use of the boathook for me to
get the Rob Roy into the proper place in the lock, and then to
keep her there.&nbsp; The men were not clumsy nor careless, but
still the polished mahogany yawl had no chance with the heavy
floats and barges in a squeezing and scratching match, and it was
always sure to go to the wall.</p>
<p>Time seemed no object to these people, they were no doubt paid
by the day.&nbsp; The sun shone upon them and it was pleasant
simply to exist and to loiter in life, so why make haste?&nbsp;
Finally we ascended as the lock filled, and then a second <!--
page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>and a third joint cut off from our too long tail of
barges had to be passed in also.&nbsp; After all, the captain and
sometimes the whole crew deliberately adjourned to the
lock-keeper&rsquo;s house for a &ldquo;glass&rdquo; and a chat;
and when that was entirely done, and every topic of the day
discussed, they all came back and had another supplemental
parliament on the steamer&rsquo;s deck, like ladies saying
&ldquo;good bye&rdquo; at a morning visit; so that, perhaps, in
an hour from beginning it, the work of ten minutes was
accomplished, and the engine turned again once more&mdash;a
tedious progress.&nbsp; Thus it was that four nights and part of
five days were passed in mounting the Seine.</p>
<p>The scenery on the banks is in many places interesting, in a
few it is pretty, and it is never positively dull.&nbsp; The
traffic on the river is considerable above Rouen; but as there
are two railways besides, few passengers go by water.&nbsp; The
architecture and engineering on this fine river are indeed
splendid.&nbsp; The noble bridges, the vast locks, barrages,
quays, barriers, and embankments are far superior to ours on the
Thames, though that river floats more wealth in a day than the
Seine does in a month.</p>
<p>The sailors and dockmen were eager for my cargo of books; and
among the various odd ways by which these had to be given to men
on large <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>vessels, there is one shown in the
sketch alongside, where the cabin-boy of a steamer looking
through the round deadlight with an imploring request in his
face, stretched out an eager hand to catch the book lifted up on
the end of one of my sculls.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<p>Then the neatness and apparent cleanliness of the villages,
and the well-clothed, well-mannered people&mdash;all so
&ldquo;respectable.&rdquo;&nbsp; France is progressing by great
leaps and bounds, at least in what arrests the eye.&nbsp; Its
progress in government, liberty, and politics, is perhaps rather
like that in a waltz.</p>
<p>Life in a towed yacht, alone on the Seine, is a somewhat hard
life.&nbsp; You have to be alert, and to steer for sometimes
twenty hours a day, and to cook and eat while steering.&nbsp; At
<!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning the
steamer&rsquo;s crew seemed suddenly to rise from the deck by
magic, and stumble over coal-sacks, and thus abruptly to begin
the day.&nbsp; We stopped about nine o&rsquo;clock at night, and
the crew flopped down on deck again, asleep in a moment, but not
I for an hour or two.</p>
<p>As the grey dawn uncovered a new and cloudless sky, the fierce
bubblings in the boiler became strong enough to turn the engine,
and our rope was slipped from the bank.&nbsp; Savoury odours from
the steamer soon after announced to me their breakfast cooking,
and the Rob Roy&rsquo;s lamp too was speedily in full
blast.&nbsp; Eggs or butter or milk were instantly purveyed, if
within reach at a lock; sometimes delicious strawberries and
other fruits or dainties, the only difficulty was to cook at all
properly while steering and being towed.</p>
<p>It is easy to cook and to steer at sea without looking up for
many minutes.&nbsp; The compass tells you by a glance, and if
not, the tiller has a nudge which speaks to the man who knows the
meaning of its various pressures, through any part of his body it
may happen to touch.&nbsp; But if you forget to steer constantly
and minutely in a heavy boat towed on a river, she swerves in an
instant, and shoots out right and left, and dives into banks or
trees, or into the steamer&rsquo;s side-swell, and the <!-- page
91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>man
at the wheel turns round with a courteous French scowl, for he
feels by <i>his</i> tiller in a moment, and you cannot escape his
rebuke.</p>
<p>There was no romance in this manner of progress up the
river.&nbsp; The poetry of wandering where you will, and all
alone, cannot be thrown around a boat pulled by the nose while
you are sitting in her all day.&nbsp; The Rob Roy, with mast
down, and tied by a tow-rope, was like an eagle limping with
clipped pinion and a chained foot.&nbsp; Still, for the man not
churlish, there is scarcely any time or place or person wholly
devoid of interest, if he is determined to find it there.</p>
<p>The steamboat captain and crew were chatty enough; and when we
towed a string of barges, the yawl was lashed alongside of one of
these (and not at the end of the line), so that I visited my
fellow-travellers, and soon became friends, and then interchanged
presents.&nbsp; All this &ldquo;Social Science&rdquo; of the
sailor was far better done by the French bargee than in
England.</p>
<p>In both countries they frequently mistook me at first for a
common sailor in charge of a yacht, for my dress told no
more.&nbsp; As intercourse proceeded it was curious to watch the
gradual recognition of the fact that this &ldquo;sailor&rdquo;
talked and thought not just the same as others.&nbsp; Then they
regarded me as an agent come to sell the pretty boat; but <!--
page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>it was in England only that any of them could be made to
believe that the owner of the Rob Roy &ldquo;would not part with
his boat, did not want a cook or cabin-boy, and was not at all
anxious to see the end of his voyage.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes the
conversation, begun as between equals, would gradually get the
word &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; sprinkled over it; and once or
twice&mdash;and this not in France&mdash;it came down at last to
that &ldquo;glass of beer,&rdquo; sheepishly enough asked for,
which of course instantly drowns the converse that has been free
on one side and independent on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Workmen,&rdquo; &ldquo;working men,&rdquo;
&ldquo;artizans,&rdquo; or whatever they are, or whatever you may
call them&mdash;I mean the class now being spoiled by petting in
England&mdash;let them be told (perhaps it may be said plainest
by their best friends) that there are just as many proud
exclusives among them as in any other stratum of society, and
that they have at least a full share too of conceit, foppery, and
affectation.</p>
<p>It may be heresy to say so, but the &ldquo;horny hand&rdquo;
has no necessary connection whatever with the &ldquo;honest
heart,&rdquo; as is the fashion to assert on one side, and almost
to believe on the other; and the friend who really does shake
that hand with a brotherly feeling is the most likely and the
best entitled to refuse to talk popular nonsense of this sort
about the &ldquo;people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>For the night we stopped usually in towns, but once or
twice we rested in a great bend of the river where the steamer
was run straight into the trees and made fast ashore exactly as
if it were on the Mississippi and not on the Seine.</p>
<p>That thousands of solitary fishermen should sit lonesome on
the river was the same puzzle to me as it had been before in
canoeing on other French streams.&nbsp; Their silence and
patience, during hours of this self-inflicted isolation, were
incredible for Frenchmen, fond as we at first think all of them
to be of &ldquo;billard,&rdquo; caf&eacute;, or dancing puppies,
of anything, in fact, provided it assumes to be lively.</p>
<p>One thing I am at last decided about, that it is not to catch
fish these men sit there; and the only reasonable explanation I
can find of the phenomenon is that all these meek and lone
fishermen are husbands unhappy at home!</p>
<p>There are numerous sailing-boats and rowing-boats on the
Seine; but I did not see one that there was any difficulty in not
coveting&mdash;their standard of marine beauty is not ours.&nbsp;
All rigs and all sizes were there, even to a great centre board
cutter, twenty-five feet broad, and any number of yards long, in
which the happy yachtsman could sail up and down between two
bridges which bounded him on either side to a two miles&rsquo;
reach!</p>
<p><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>The French national flag is perhaps the prettiest on the
world&rsquo;s waters; but as it is repeated to the eye by every
boat and building, the sight of it becomes tiresome, and suggests
that absence of private influence and enterprise so striking to
an Englishman in every French work.&nbsp; Then again their
sailors (not to say their landsmen) in very many instances do not
even know our English flag when they see it, our union-jack or
ensign flying free on every shore.</p>
<p>At first I used to carry the French flag as well as our
British jack out of compliment to their country, but as I found
out that even in some of their newspapers the Rob Roy was
mentioned as a &ldquo;beautiful little French yacht,&rdquo; I
determined that <i>that</i> mistake at any rate should not be
fostered by me, so down came the tricolour, and my Cambridge
Boat-club flag took its place.</p>
<p>In one reach of the river we came upon a very unusual sight
for a week day, a French yacht sailing.&nbsp; Her flag was
half-mast high, and she was drifting down the stream, a helpless
wreck.&nbsp; A distracted sort of man was on board, and a lady,
or womankind at least, with dishevelled locks (carefully
disordered though), the picture of wan weary wretchedness, and
both of these hapless ones entreated our captain to tow their
little yacht home.&nbsp; But, after a knowing glance, he quickly
<!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>passed them in silence, and another steamer behind us
also rounded off so as to give the unhappy pair the widest
possible berth.&nbsp; Perhaps both captains preferred English
sovereigns to French francs.</p>
<p>I was charged about 3<i>l</i>. for being towed to Paris; but
the various steamers (six in all) I employed on the river were
every one well managed, and with civil people on board.&nbsp;
Indeed, I became a favourite with one captain&rsquo;s wife, a
sturdy-looking body, always cutting up leaves of lettuce.&nbsp;
She gave me a basin of warm soup, and I presented her with some
good Yorkshire bacon.&nbsp; Next day she cooked some of this for
me with beans, and I returned the present by a packet of London
tea, a book, a picture of Napoleon, and another of &ldquo;the Rob
Roy on the Seine,&rdquo; in the highest style of art attainable
by a man steering all the time he is at the easel.</p>
<p>From all this it will be readily understood by any one who has
travelled much in various ways that to be towed up the Seine is
quite different from all other modes of progress, and that it
brings you among a large, new, and sharply-defined class of
people, who could scarcely be known, and certainly could not be
studied so well in any other way.</p>
<p>Nor is the traveller less interesting to these <!-- page
96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>people than they are to him.&nbsp; Often it was
necessary to restrain the inquisitive French <i>gamins</i>, who
would teaze a boat to pieces if not looked after; but it is
always against the grain with me to be strict with boys,
especially about boats, for I hold that it is a good sign of them
when they relish nautical curiosities.</p>

Cloud&mdash;Training-Dogs&mdash;Wrong colours&mdash;My
policeman&mdash;Yankee notion.&mdash;Red, White, and Blue.</p>
<p>The effect of living on board a little boat for a month at a
time without more than three or four nights of usual repose, was
to bring the mind and body into a curious condition of subdued
life, a sort of contemplative oriental placid state in which both
cares and pleasures ceased to be acute, and the flight of time
seemed gliding and even, and not marked by the distinct epochs
which define our civilised life.&nbsp; Although this passive
enjoyment was really agreeable&mdash;and, in fine weather and
good health, perhaps a mollusc could affirm as much of its
existence,&mdash;certainly an experience of the condition I have
described enables one to understand what is evidently the normal
state of many thousands of hard-worked, ill-fed, and
irregularly-sleeped <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>labourers; the men who, sitting down
thus weary at night, we expect to read some prosy book full of
desperately good advice, of which one half the words are not
needed for the sense and the other half are not understood by the
reader. <a name="citation98"></a><a href="#footnote98"
class="citation">[98]</a></p>
<p>The last tug-boat we had to use was of a peculiar kind, and I
am not aware that it is employed upon any of our rivers in
Britain.&nbsp; A chain is laid along the bottom of the Seine for
(I think) two hundred miles.&nbsp; At certain hours of the day a
long solidly-built vessel with a powerful engine on board comes
over this, and the chain is seized and put round a wheel on
board.&nbsp; By turning this wheel one way or the other it is
evident that the chain will be wound up and let down behind,
while it cannot slip along the river&rsquo;s bottom&mdash;the
enormous friction is enough to prevent that, and therefore the
boat is wound up and goes through the water.&nbsp; The power of
this chain-boat is so great that it will pull along, and that too
against the rapid stream, a whole string of barges, several of
them <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>of 300 tons&rsquo; burthen.&nbsp; The long fleet
advances steadily though slowly, and the irresistible engine
works with smokeless funnels, but there are groanings within,
telling of tight-strained iron, and earnest undertoned breathings
of confined steam.</p>
<p>Although the chain-boat is not often steered for the purpose
of avoiding other vessels (these must take care of their own
safety), yet it has to be carefully managed by the rudders (one
at each end), so that it may drop the chain in a proper part of
the river for the next steamer of the Company which is to use
it.&nbsp; When two such boats meet from opposite directions, and
both are pulling at the same chain, there is much time lost in
effecting a passage, and again when the chain-boat and all its
string of heavy craft arrives at a lock, you may make up your
mind for a long delay.&nbsp; It is evident that we do not require
this particular sort of tug-boat on the Thames below Teddington,
for the strong tide up and down twice every day carries along
thousands of tons of merchandize at a rapid pace, and one or two
men will be enough to attend upon each barge.&nbsp; In fact we
have the sun and moon for our tugs.&nbsp; These draw the water
up, and the tide is the rope which hauls our ships along.</p>
<p>To man&oelig;uvre properly with the Rob Roy in such a case as
this with the chain-boat required every vigilance, and strong
exercise of muscular <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>force, as well as caution and prompt
decision, for I had sometimes to cling to the middle barge, then
to drop back to the last, and always to keep off from the
river-banks, the shoals, and the trees.&nbsp; On one occasion we
had to shift her position by &ldquo;kedging&rdquo; for nearly
half a mile, and this in a crowded part of the Seine too, where
the current also was swift.&nbsp; On another occasion the sharp
iron of a screw steamer&rsquo;s frame ran right against my bow,
and at once cut a clean hole quite through the mahogany.&nbsp;
Instantly I seized a lump of soft putty, and leaning over the
side I squeezed it into the hole, and then &ldquo;clinched&rdquo;
it (so to speak) on the inside; and this stop-gap actually served
for three weeks, until a proper repair could be made.</p>
<p>The lovely precincts of St. Cloud came in sight at dawn on the
last day of June, prettier than Richmond, I must confess, or
almost any river-town we can boast of in England; and here I was
to rest while my little yawl was thoroughly cleaned, brightly
varnished, and its inside gaily painted with Cambridge blue, so
as to appear at the French Exhibition in its very best suit, and
then at the British Regatta on the Seine.</p>
<p>Some days were occupied in this general overhaul, during which
the excellent landlady of the hotel where I slept must have been
more amazed even than she declared, to see her guest return <!--
page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>each day clad in blue flannel, and spattered all over
with varnish and paint, for the captain was painter as well as
cook.&nbsp; Of course all this was exchanged for proper attire
after working hours.</p>
<p>In the cool of the morning, three fine young fellows are
running towards us over the bridge; with lithe and easy step,
speed but not haste, and in white flannel and white shoes.&nbsp;
They have come to contend at the regatta here, the first of an
invasion of British oarsmen, who soon fill the lodgings, cover
the river, and waken up the footpath early with their rattling
run.&nbsp; Some of these are brown-faced watermen from Thames and
Humber and Tyne, others are ruddy-cheeked Etonians or University
men, or hard-trained Londoners, and others have come over the
Atlantic; John Bull&rsquo;s younger brothers from New Brunswick,
not his cousins from New York.&nbsp; You might pick out among
these the finest specimens of our species, so far as pluck and
muscle make the man.</p>
<p>Few of the French oarsmen could be classed with any of the
divisions given above.&nbsp; Rowing has not attained the position
in France which it holds in England.&nbsp; For much of our
excellence in athletics and field sports we have to thank our
well-abused English climate, which always encourages and
generally necessitates some sort of exercise when we are out of
doors.</p>
<p><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>But it is a new and healthy sight on the Seine, these
fine fellows running in the mornings, and it gives zest to our
walk by the beautiful river.</p>
<p>Here also as we stroll about, two dogs gave us much amusement:
one was a Newfoundland, who dashed into the water grandly to
fetch the stick thrown in by his master.&nbsp; The other was a
bulldog, who went in about a yard or so at the same time, and
then as the swimmer brought the stick to shore the intruder
fastened on it, and always managed somehow to wrest the prize
from the real winner, and then carried it to his master with the
cool impudence which may be seen not seldom when the honour and
reward gained by one person are claimed and even secured by
another. <a name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a></p>
<p>From the truck to the keel the Rob Roy had been thoroughly
refreshed and beautified.&nbsp; The perfection of a yacht&rsquo;s
beauty is that nothing <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>should be
there for only beauty&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; In the strict
observance of this rule the English certainly do excel every
other nation; and whether you take a huge steam-engine, a yacht,
or a four-in-hand drag, it is certainly acknowledged by the best
connoisseurs of each, that ornament will not make a bad article
good, while it is likely to make a good one look bad.</p>
<p>Even the flags of a yacht have each a meaning, and are not
mere patches of pretty colours.&nbsp; Therefore they ought to be
made, at all events, perfectly correct first, and then as pretty
and neat as you please.&nbsp; I examined the flags of all the
boats and yachts and steamers at the Exhibition; and there was
wonderfully little taste in their display; nearly every
one&mdash;English and foreign&mdash;was cut wrong, or coloured
wrong, or too large for the boat that carried them.&nbsp; Even
our Admiralty Barge, where specimens of boats from England were
exhibited, had a flag flying, with the stripes in the
&lsquo;jack&rsquo; quite wrong.&nbsp; She was the only craft on
that side of the Pont de Jena; but as it was the English side I
anchored there, right opposite the sloping sward of the
Exhibition, and I did this without asking any questions, for it
is best now and then to do right things at once, and not to delay
until time is wasted in proving them to be right.</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Here I slept on board my little craft in perfect
comfort, and could spend all the rest of the day on shore.&nbsp;
Each morning about 7 o&rsquo;clock you might notice a
smart-looking French policeman standing on the grass bank of the
Exhibition, and staring hard at the Rob Roy.&nbsp; He had come to
see her captain at his somewhat airy toilette, and he was
particularly interested, and even amazed, to witness the
evolutions of a toothbrush, which were not only interesting but
instructive as involving an idea perfectly new&mdash;hard also to
comprehend from so distant an inspection.&nbsp; Surely he thought
this strange implement must be a novelty imported from England
for exhibition here.</p>
<p>As he gazed in wonder at the rapid exercise, I sometimes gave
the curious instrument an extra flourish above or below, and the
intelligent and courteous gendarme never rightly decided whether
or not the toothbrush was an essential though inscrutable part of
the yacht&rsquo;s sailing gear.&nbsp; Our acquaintance, however,
improved, and he kindly took charge of the boat in my absence;
not without a mysterious air as he recounted its travels (and a
good deal more), to the numerous visitors,&mdash;many of whom,
after his explanations, left the Rob Roy quite delighted that
they had seen &ldquo;the little ship which had sailed from
America!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>The boat &ldquo;Red, White, and Blue&rdquo; he thus
confounded with mine&mdash;was at that time not far off, in a
house by itself, amid the other wonders which crowded the gardens
of the Exhibition.</p>

<p>The two venturesome Americans who came to Europe in this ship
had but scant pleasure either in their voyage itself or in their
visit to France and England.&nbsp; Storm, wet, and hunger on the
wide Atlantic were patiently borne in hopes of meeting a warm
welcome in Old England; but, instead, they had the cold chill of
doubt.&nbsp; Many of their sufferings in both these ways were
directly due to their <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>own and their friends&rsquo;
mismanagement, the stupid construction of their cabin, the
foolish three-masted rig of their boat, the boastful wager of the
boat&rsquo;s builder, and their imprudence in painting up the
boat on her arrival, and tarring the ropes; and, lastly, in
allowing a mutilated paper to be issued as their &ldquo;original
log.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disappointed here, they turned to Paris, expecting better
days.&nbsp; Fair promises were made.&nbsp; Steamers were to tow
the boat up the Seine in triumph; but it was towed against a
bridge and smashed its masts.&nbsp; Agents were to secure goodly
numbers to visit her; but for three months scarcely any one paid
for a ticket, until at length the vessel was admitted into the
grounds of the Exhibition.&nbsp; Finally, the ruined Captain ran
away to England, but cleverly contrived to carry his ship with
him.&nbsp; Whatever may be thought as to the wisdom or advantage
of making such a voyage and in such a boat, it is a very great
pity that when it has been effected there should be a failure in
appreciating its marvellous accomplishment.</p>
<p>The possibility of taking a boat across the Atlantic, with
west wind prevailing and with no rocks or shoals to fear, is
altogether beyond doubt.&nbsp; The ill-fate of two other boats
that have tried the feat shews how dangerous it is to try.&nbsp;
The success of another more recent trip of &lsquo;man and <!--
page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>wife&rsquo; in one boat is reassuring.&nbsp; But after
examining, probably more than any body else, the evidence in
their case&mdash;the men, the log, the documents, and affidavits,
and the boat, and its contents, also the numerous doubts and
criticisms from all quarters, both in London and Paris, and in
Dover and Margate, I have good reason to believe that the
&ldquo;Red, White, and Blue&rdquo; had no extraneous help in her
voyage across that wide ocean.&nbsp; The unexplained wonder is
that men able and willing to perform such a deed as this should
be incapable of building and rigging their boat so as to do it
comfortably.</p>

<p>As they walked past the building where this travelled ship was
shewn, many of the visitors seemed each to be reading a paper in
his hands, while some have a gilt-edged book, and others a
broadsheet with a large woodcut on it.</p>
<p>These people have come past that other building, which seems
to be all windows; and let us stop there a few minutes to see why
the groups crowd round, and reach out their hands, and go away
reading.</p>
<p>If you heard that it is &ldquo;only some tracts&rdquo; being
given away, and then turned away yourself, you have lost a
wonderful sight: one that, well pondered upon, has wide
suggestions to the mind that thinks; and a sight that, of its
kind, was quite unexampled at any time and anywhere.&nbsp; Inside
this building, and another near it, were hundreds <!-- page
109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>of
thousands of Bibles, Testaments, periodicals, papers, picture
books and tracts, beautifully printed in the languages of
visitors from distant lands, and mostly given free to those who
will receive them.</p>
<p>Even in England, at none of our Exhibitions or any other
place, had such a proceeding been permitted, doubtless from
prudential reasons,&mdash;the fear of &ldquo;giving
offence&rdquo; or exciting disturbance; so that it had been left
to France, at a time when pleasure seemed the chief and only
object of all, to brave these supposed dangers, and, despite all
scruples, to give utmost freedom to the distribution of
God&rsquo;s Word and of man&rsquo;s comments upon it.&nbsp; The
example was not without fruit; at each subsequent Grand
Exhibition, and even under the Republic in 1878, the Book of Law
and Gospel has been freely given in the frivolous capital of
France.</p>
<p>The fact is, if you mean to get at all the people, you cannot
find them in the same place or reach them by the same road, or
treat them in the same way; and all the people must be got at
somehow.</p>
<p>As fast as they could give these books and papers out of the
windows, several persons were delivering them into the open hands
of the people, and when a window became vacant, and there was
need of some one to help, the post was filled by the crew of the
yawl.</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>We intended to stay only a short time, but six hours
often passed before the interesting work could be left; I can
never forget those hours, and the subsequent occasions of the
same sort.</p>
<p>Every variety of person came quickly before us, of
nationality, of manner, of dress, of language, and of bearing, as
each drew near, took a paper, read a few lines, thanked the
donor, and then went off reading as they walked, or with
reflecting gaze, or simply astonished.</p>
<p>Hundreds of soldiers came to the window, sometimes a dozen of
them at once, and these all asked for their
&lsquo;Empereur.&rsquo;&nbsp; This meant the special copy of the
well-known periodical &lsquo;British Workman,&rsquo; which was
translated into French, and had a very large and well-done
woodcut of Napoleon III. on its broad first page.&nbsp; The
generosity of some good men supplied funds to give one of these
Emperor papers to every soldier, policeman, and public
employ&eacute;; and much additional interest was attached to the
paper because it was actually printed before their eyes at a
press in the centre of the building, and because the press itself
had borne off a gold medal for excellence of workmanship. <a

<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Priests came often, and even returned to get tracts for
their villages in distant parts of France.&nbsp; Germans asked
for papers in &ldquo;Allemand,&rdquo; and numerous Italians and
Spaniards asked for them in their languages.&nbsp; Two Russians
came, but we had then no books in Russ; and at length four grave
Mussulmen stood before me in turbans and flowing robes, with a
suppliant but dignified air, while their interpreter said they
wanted to buy a &ldquo;dictionary to learn English
from.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now they will easily get these dictionaries in
the &ldquo;Beaconsfield Library&rdquo; of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Although in frequent tours in foreign lands we had been
accustomed to see minglings of the people from many nations, the
sight at this window was more varied in the components of the
constant flowing stream of human beings for hours and hours than
we ever saw before.</p>
<p>Some years ago, travelling in Algeria with an Arab guide, I
put up for the night at an old semaphore station, where was a
French soldier in charge.&nbsp; It was far from any houses, and
on a high hill, and he had a visit only every fortnight <!-- page
112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>from his friends, who brought him provisions on
mules&rsquo; backs.&nbsp; He willingly let me in, and spread a
mattress for me on the floor alongside his own.&nbsp; The Arab he
kept outside, and the poor fellow had to sleep coiled up on the
doorstep.</p>
<p>The Frenchman was courteous and intelligent; but he had only
one thing to read for many weeks, a vapid French novel.&nbsp; He
said he would willingly read something better if he had it.&nbsp;
At the next French town I searched for some better book, and this
caused me to find the agent of the Bible Society, and so a parcel
of books, religious and secular, were sent off to the telegraph
station; but my attention once drawn to the French soldiers and
their reading, it was impossible not to follow a subject so
interesting and important.&nbsp; The regiment quartered in the
town had but a few Testaments. <a name="citation112"></a><a
href="#footnote112" class="citation">[112]</a>&nbsp; By a little
exertion about a hundred copies were obtained and
distributed.&nbsp; I saw the men reading these in the streets for
hours under the trees, and I sailed in a man-of-war carrying the
regiment to Mexico.&nbsp; Not one in five of these men survived
that fearful campaign.</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Priestly opposition to this giving of Testaments
resulted in an appeal to the General in command.&nbsp; He asked
the priests if the book was a &ldquo;bad one,&rdquo; and when it
was not possible to say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; he gave the book free
course.&nbsp; Inquiry was excited by this opposition, and 1500
Testaments were received.</p>
<p>There was a remarkable contrast between the absence of public
efforts by French Romanists to disseminate their opinions at the
Exhibition and the unusual freedom for others, sanctioned by the
late Archbishop of Paris.&nbsp; Various causes were at work to
produce this very unexpected state of things, and they will not
be alluded to here.&nbsp; But the points thus noticed remind one
forcibly of what actually occurred in 1851, when the then
Archbishop of Paris specially appointed the Abb&eacute; Miel, a
learned and able man, to go to London and to do his best to
further Romanism here during the Exhibition.</p>
<p>One of his first acts was to issue two small tracts on the
supremacy of the Pope and of St. Peter; and some hundred thousand
of these, beautifully printed, were distributed in London.&nbsp;
A copy came to the hands of a clever layman, well skilled in the
Romish controversy; and he saw immediately that this little
tract, if not well answered, might do much harm.</p>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>After careful study of the subject, he wrote to the
Abb&eacute;, calling attention to several important misquotations
in the tract, which were evident when it was compared with
original documents in the British Museum.&nbsp; The Abb&eacute;
replied, that he was not responsible for the accuracy of the
extracts, but that they had been given to him by the late
Cardinal Wiseman.</p>
<p>The Protestant layman then wrote a series of letters in a
well-known English newspaper, <i>Bell&rsquo;s Weekly
Messenger</i>, upon the subject treated in the tract, and for the
time the matter dropped.&nbsp; Years afterwards he received a
letter from the Abb&eacute;, stating that these newspaper
articles had convinced him of the need of inquiry into the
subject, and he went to Rome to consult his former
instructors.&nbsp; Finally, this Abb&eacute;, selected as the
champion of Rome by the Archbishop of Paris, and convinced by the
arguments adduced by a layman in London, renounced the Romish
church, and though offered promotion for his past services, he
came to London and went straight to the house of the layman, whom
he had not yet seen.</p>
<p>Often have I walked with that clever Abb&eacute;, riveted by
his deeply interesting conversation, his new and fresh views of
English life, his forcible exposures of those false estimates of
Protestant <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>truth which had for so many years
blinded him, and his explanations of the machinery then in action
at the Oratory, near the Strand.</p>
<p>But his former allies could not brook the desertion of so
formidable a champion, and he was driven by their continual
annoyance to seek another home.&nbsp; So he went to Ireland, and
soon became the best teacher of the French language in Dublin,
from whence he removed to America.&nbsp; Let us hope that there,
at least, he is free to profess the truth he had found, and to be
one of the instances&mdash;very rare indeed they are&mdash;of a
consistent and steady Protestant, who had for years before been
thoroughly imbued with those doctrines which gnaw at the very
vitals of mental perception, and obliterate the sense of
fairness, and which very seldom leave enough alive in the mind to
hold even real truth firmly.</p>
<p>It will not be breaking the promise that our visit to the
exhibition is not to involve us in a description of all its
wonders, if we walk up-stairs and look into the Tunisian
Caf&eacute;, attracted by the well-known drumming and the moaning
dirge which Easterns call music.&nbsp; Tunis is best seen out of
Tunis, for the broidered gold and bright-coloured slippers can
then be enjoyed without those horrible scenes of filth&mdash;dead
camels, open sewers, and maimed beggars which encase the <!--
page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>shabby mud walls I have seen so near the marble ruins
of old Carthage.</p>
<p>The caf&eacute; was full of visitors.&nbsp; English and
Americans were admiring a pretty singing girl about fifteen years
of age, who was beautifully dressed, and sitting with four very
demure and ugly Orientals in the little orchestra.</p>
<p>Soon she rose and sang a song.&nbsp; Black eyes, blackest of
hair, pale cheeks, languid grace.&nbsp; She is a fair daughter
from the rising sun.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, there is certainly
something in their Eastern beauty which is quite beyond what
Britons or Yankees see at home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the words and music of the song seemed known to me.&nbsp;
Surely she is now singing English while she shakes the golden
sequins in her long jet hair and rattles her tambourine?&nbsp; We
asked a waiter, and he said she could sing Turkish, Spanish,
French, and English.&nbsp; At last being persuaded that her
pronunciation of English was too distinct for a foreigner, we
took the very bold measure of going up to the orchestra, and
saying to the young lady, &ldquo;You are English, are you
not?&rdquo;&nbsp; She stared, and held down her face, which still
was pale, even if she blushed and answered &ldquo;Yes,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you here alone?&mdash;no relation,
no woman friend with you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And do they treat you well?&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From what part of
England?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From ---shire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said she seemed to mean the words of the song she had
sung,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I wish I were a bird, and I would flee
away.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I asked if she could read, and would like a nice
book.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, I should, and very much.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now there was a stall set up in the Exhibition by &ldquo;The Pure
Literature Society,&rdquo; from 11, Buckingham Street, Adelphi,
London, which selects about three thousand books from various
publishers, but publishes none itself; gets no profits on its
sales except thanks and satisfaction; so that its catalogue is
likely to contain what it may wish should be read. <a
name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117"
class="citation">[117]</a>&nbsp; Here we selected a very
interesting volume with many illustrations, suitable for the
girl&rsquo;s reading; and soon at the caf&eacute; again, I bowed
to the senior fiddler, who nodded assent, and then the poor pale
lonely girl had the pleasant book as a remembrance of home placed
in her hands, and a promise given her that a good Christian lady
would call that evening.</p>
<p>So perhaps our catalogue of nationalities at the Exhibition
ought to be somewhat abridged, and not <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>wholly
founded upon the variety it presents to the eye; especially as in
London, too, we may remember Punch&rsquo;s crossing-sweeper, who,
being dressed in Hindoo garb, begged from a passer-by with,
&ldquo;Take pity on the poor Irishman&mdash;Injun, I
mane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Sunday the little dingey had its usual cargo, and the
bargemen on the Seine, in the heart of Paris, were just as glad
as others elsewhere to get something to read.</p>
<p>Among the curiosities exhibited in the English Naval
Architecture building here was a very beautiful model of the Rob
Roy canoe, presented to its owner by the builders, Messrs.
Searle, who have already built some hundreds of such canoes on
the principles first applied in that above mentioned; and to me
it was even more gratifying to find in the Admiralty Barge, the
Rob Roy canoe itself, with sails set and the flag of the Royal
Canoe Club flying, and with maps of the paddling voyages through
Europe.</p>
<p>Very speedily I launched my old travelling companion, and had
a paddle up the river by moonlight, and it was surprising to find
that scarcely any water leaked in, though the other boats which
were hung up in the barge were found to be a good deal injured by
the strong draught of wind rushing through the arch of the
bridge, and then under the open sides of the shed, covered <!--
page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>only by a roof.&nbsp; But then those other boats were
new, and perhaps some were not built of such well-seasoned wood
<a name="citation119"></a><a href="#footnote119"
class="citation">[119]</a> as Messrs. Searle employ beyond all
other boat-builders I know; whereas the weatherbeaten Rob Roy had
been too long inured to wet and dry, sun and wind, heat and cold,
to be affected with the rheumatism and ague which shook even the
man-of-war&rsquo;s boats on the barge.</p>
<p>The sketch (see next page), represents a man watering a horse,
and who swum it out to my boat to get a paper, and then carefully
placed the gift in a dry place ashore until he should be able to
use it when he was dressed again.</p>
<p>My life at the Exhibition soon settled into a somewhat regular
one.&nbsp; Seeing, seeing, seeing all day, and then returning to
my quiet bed on the river at night, with a &lsquo;Times&rsquo;
newspaper to study, and books and letters.&nbsp; It was a variety
<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>to launch the dingey, and scull along the quays and
visit the other yachts, all of them most hospitable to the Rob
Roy.&nbsp; I ventured even to go alongside the Turkish vessel,
the <i>Dahabeeh</i>, from the Nile, full of specimen
&ldquo;fellahs,&rdquo; all hidden by a curtain of grey calico,
except to those who had paid their franc for general
entrance.&nbsp; We never observed any visitor actually on board
this vessel; indeed, it required a bold inquirer to face those
solemn Africans&rsquo; gaze, as they sat cross-legged on deck,
and ate their soup from a universal bowl, or calmly inspired from
their chibouques, and blew <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>out a
formal and composed puff of the bluest tobacco-smoke.&nbsp; It
did, indeed, soon forcibly recall the feelings of Egyptian travel
to see these men;&mdash;the red fiery sunsets, the palm-trees,
and crocodiles, and obelisks, and Indian corn, and, over all, the
thrumming, not unmusical sound of the
<i>tarabookrah</i>&mdash;earthen drum&mdash;with the wailing
melodies in a minor key of the &ldquo;Chald&aelig;ans whose cry
is in the ships.&rdquo; <a name="citation121"></a><a
href="#footnote121" class="citation">[121]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p120b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>So I ventured near in my dingey, and the imperturbable
Egyptians were fairly taken by surprise.&nbsp; They soon rallied
to a word or two in their language and an Englishman&rsquo;s
smile, and rapidly we became friends, and talked of Damascus and
Constantinople, and finally decided that &ldquo;Englishman
bono!&rdquo;&nbsp; The shape and minute dimensions of my dingey
much astonished them; but they probably believed, that in that
very craft I had come all the way from London.</p>
<p>The luxury of Paris must have at least some effect in making
<i>gourmands</i> of the young generation, even if their fathers
did not set the example.&nbsp; The operation, or rather the
solemn function, of breakfast or dinner, is with many Frenchmen
the only serious act in life.&nbsp; When people can afford <!--
page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>to order a dinner in exact accordance with the lofty
standard of excellence meant by its being &ldquo;good,&rdquo; the
diner approaches the great proceeding with a staid and watchful
air, and we may well leave him now he is involved in such
important service.&nbsp; But with the <i>octroi</i> duty for even
a single pheasant at two shillings and sixpence, there are many
good feeders who cannot afford to &ldquo;dine well,&rdquo; and
the fuss they make about their eatables is something
preposterous.&nbsp; It is a vice&mdash;this systematic
gluttony&mdash;that seems to be steadily increasing in France for
the last twenty years, at least in its public manifestation, and
moreover it is an evil somewhat contagious.</p>
<p>One evening, while some of us had dinner at the Terrasse in
St. Cloud, a family entered the room, and were partly disrobing
themselves of bonnets and hats for a regular downright dinner,
when the waiter came, and in reply to the order of a
&ldquo;<i>friture</i>&rdquo; he calmly said they had none.</p>
<p>At this awful news the whole party were struck dumb and pale,
and they leant back on their chairs as if in a swoon.&nbsp; The
poor waiter prudently retreated for reinforcements, and the
landlady herself came in to face the infuriate guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No friture!&rdquo; said the father.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
friture, and we come to St. Cloud?&rdquo; he muttered deeply in
rage.&nbsp; His wife proceeded to make horribly <!-- page
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>wry faces, whereat Rob Roy irreverently laughed, but he
was not observed, for they noticed nothing of the external
trifling world.&nbsp; The daughters heaved deep sighs, and then
burst into voluble and loud denunciations.&nbsp; Then the son
(who wanted dinner at any rate, and the objurgations might do
afterwards) proposed at once to leave the desolate,
famine-stricken spot.</p>
<p>But though this was debated warmly, it was not carried.&nbsp;
They had already anchored, as it were, and they resolved to dine
&ldquo;starving,&rdquo; and to grumble all the time of dinner
when no one subject was talked about except the
<i>friture</i>.&nbsp; It was a miserable spectacle to witness,
but confirming the proposition, not at all new, that the French
care more about eating than even John Bull.</p>

Regatta&mdash;Absentees&mdash;Novelties&mdash;New
Brunswickers&mdash;Steam yachts&mdash;Canoe race&mdash;Canoe
chase&mdash;Entangled&mdash;M. Forcat&mdash;Challenge.</p>
<p>While the voyage in the Rob Roy&rsquo;s dingey on Sunday was
such as we have described, it was a busy time a little further
down the river at St. Cloud, being the first day of the Paris
Regatta, which continued also on the Monday, and then our British
Regatta occupied the next four days.&nbsp; These two were under
separate committees.&nbsp; The British Regatta was managed by
experienced oarsmen, and His Royal Highness the Commodore of the
Canoe Club was patron&mdash;not a merely nominal patron but
presiding frequently at the committee meetings held at
Marlborough House, and generously contributing to the
funds.&nbsp; The Emperor of the French also gave us his name, and
prizes to the amount of 1000<i>l</i>. were offered in a series of
contests open to all the world.&nbsp; In these better days now
the rowing world of France could lately <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>count upon
the patronage of their distinguished Foreign Minister, M.
Waddington, who rowed in the same boat with me at
Cambridge&mdash;&lsquo;ages ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this experiment of holding an international regatta in a
foreign country was quite novel, and there were difficulties
around it which it is not convenient to detail.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the hasty predictions of people who could not
approve of what was originated and carried out without requiring
their advice, the regatta brought together a splendid body of the
best oarsmen and canoeists in the world from England, France, and
America.&nbsp; Three Champions of England for the first time
contended at the same place.&nbsp; The most renowned watermen
came from Thames and Tyne and Humber, and eight-oared boats raced
for the first time on the Seine.&nbsp; The weather was
magnificent, the course was in perfect order, and better than
almost any other of equal length near any capital; the
arrangements made were the very best that might be contrived
under the peculiarly difficult circumstances which could not be
controlled, even by a committee comprising the very best men for
the purpose, and zealous in their work; and lastly the racing
itself, for spirit and for speed, and for that exciting interest
which is caused by equal excellence sustained during
well-contested struggles, was never surpassed.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>But this grand exhibition of water athletics was not
seen by more than a few hundreds of persons, so that
&ldquo;Tribunes,&rdquo; richly draped, and with streamers flying
above, and seats below for 1000 visitors, often had not three
people there at a time.</p>
<p>The French oarsmen must have been absent at some
&ldquo;better&rdquo; place, and of the French public you might
see more of them assembled on the roadside round a dancing
dog.&nbsp; The Emperor could not come&mdash;perhaps Bismarck
would not let him, and as the Prince of Wales had to be in his
proper place as the representative of England, receiving the
Sultan in London, this important duty prevented His Royal
Highness from enjoying the pleasure he might well have counted
upon after the trouble he had taken in connection with the
British Regatta in Paris.</p>
<p>But after stating this disappointment bluntly, it will be
remembered by all who were at St. Cloud, that there was a great
deal of real amusement, as well as of hard work, and the whole
had a strange novelty both in its charms and its troubles.</p>
<p>For crews in &ldquo;hard training&rdquo; to sit down to
<i>bifteck</i>, and Medoc, omelette, and <i>haricots verts</i>,
with strawberries and cream, and bad French jabbered round, was
certainly a novelty.&nbsp; To see a group of London watermen,
addressed in unknown tongues, but perfectly self-possessed,
visiting <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the Exhibition in the morning and
rowing a race in the afternoon, was new; and to observe the
complete bewilderment of soldiers and police at the whole
proceedings, which came upon them of course with surprise in a
country where no one reads the papers for an advertisement,
except about a new play, or an infallible pill&mdash;all this was
very amusing to those who could listen and look on.</p>
<p>The English rowing-men soon made themselves as comfortable as
they could in their new quarters, and suffered patiently the
disagreeables of French lodgings.&nbsp; They repaired their
boats, often broken by the transit from London, and behaved with
good humour in proportion to their good sense.&nbsp; Even the
grumblers were satisfied, because they were provided with a new
set of grievances; and so things passed off better than was
expected by those who knew the real circumstances of the
venture.&nbsp; It was the first regatta of the kind, and
doubtless it will be the last.</p>
<p>No particular description of the various races for eight-oars,
four-oars, pair-oars, and sculling, by watermen and amateurs,
would be interesting to general readers; but a few notable
lessons were there to be learned, which will probably not be
disregarded.</p>
<p>An interesting feature was added to the occasion <!-- page
128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>by
the arrival of four men, who came from New Brunswick, to row at
this regatta.&nbsp; They had no coxswain to steer them, as every
other boat had, but the rudder was worked by strings leading to
one of the rowers&rsquo; feet.</p>
<p>They contended first in a race where it was not allowed to use
&ldquo;outrigged&rdquo; boats (so called because they are so
narrow that the oars cannot work on the gunwale, but are rigged
out on iron frames).&nbsp; Moreover, they rowed in a broad,
heavy, clumsy-looking craft, with common oars like those used at
sea, and they pulled a short jerky stroke, and had to go round a
winding French course&mdash;indeed with apparently every
disadvantage; yet they came in first, beating English and French,
and winning 40<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The same crew went in next for another race, and in another
boat, an outrigger they had brought with them from the Dominion
of Canada, and again they were first, and won 40<i>l</i>. more.
<a name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128"
class="citation">[128]</a>&nbsp; At once &ldquo;Les
Canadiens&rdquo; became the favourites and heroes of the
day.&nbsp; Englishmen cheered them because they were the winners,
and some Frenchmen cheered them because they supposed the men
were French, whereat the hardy Canadians smiled with French
politeness, but muttering the <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>while round
protestations, intelligible only to English ears.</p>
<p>The river Seine was made unusually lively during the summer by
the movement upon it of a whole fleet of steamers of all shapes
and sizes, and with flags often exceedingly
&lsquo;coquet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Little screw yachts or steam launches
flitted up and down, sometimes so small as to admit only three or
four people on board, with a bit of awning to deflect the sun;
others were crowded with passengers.&nbsp; This style of
locomotion is peculiarly adapted to Parisians.&nbsp; It has all
the heat, bustle, and noise that can be desirable in nautical
pleasures, and yet it almost avoids those highly inconvenient
undulations which open water has too often the bad taste to
assume.&nbsp; The completion of the Thames Embankment and of the
purification of our river has already made water travelling more
fashionable in London.&nbsp; Soon, perhaps, the Representative of
some powerful Trades-union or incorrupt Borough, will see by the
Westminster Clock that it is time to go down to the
&ldquo;House,&rdquo; and will order his double-screw steamer
round to the water steps near his terrace door; and no coachman
in those days need apply for a place unless he can steer.</p>
<p>Even now, the number of miniature steamers, tug-boats, and
private yachts on the Thames is <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>large and
increasing; while a few years ago not one was to be seen.&nbsp;
Most of these are pretty little things, and the best of all craft
to be handled safely in the crowded waterway.&nbsp; The multitude
of them one sees at Stockholm shews what may be seen some day in
Middlesex.</p>
<p>Several English screw yachts had come to Paris.&nbsp; Mr.
Manners Sutton kindly lent his to the Regatta Committee, and the
steam launch of the Admiralty Barge was also used, so that the
umpire was able to follow each race in a proper position for
seeing fair play, while the Rob Roy was anchored at the
winning-post, to guard the palm of victory.&nbsp; Here, too,
various bomb-shells were fired high into the air at the end of
each race, and were supposed to correspond in number with the
place of the winning boat on the programme; but somehow they so
exploded as effectually to confuse the audience they were meant
to enlighten as to &ldquo;who had won:&rdquo; which uncertainty,
we all know, is one of the principal excitements of a regatta,
and it can be sometimes prolonged even until the day
afterwards.</p>
<p>The other features of these rowing matches on the Seine may be
left to the reader&rsquo;s imagination if he has seen a regatta
before; and if he has not seen one, he could not well apprehend
the thing by reading.&nbsp; The canoe races, however, <!-- page
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>being more novel, have another claim on attention.</p>
<p>One of these races was for fast canoes, and to be decided only
by speed.&nbsp; The other was a &ldquo;canoe chase,&rdquo; in
which dexterity and pluck were required for success.</p>
<p>For the canoe race three Englishmen had brought from the
Thames three long boats with long paddles, and they were the
three fastest canoes in England, so far as could be proved by
previous trials.&nbsp; Against these, three French canoes were
entered, all of them short, and with short paddles.&nbsp; One of
these, propelled by an Englishman (resident in Paris), came in
easily first, and the second prize was won by a Frenchman.&nbsp;
Here, surely, was a good sound lesson to English canoe-men who
wished to paddle fast on still water, in a boat useless for any
other purpose, and slower at last than a skiff with two
sculls.&nbsp; Accordingly, we accepted the beating with
thanks.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Canoe Chase,&rsquo; first instituted at our Club
races on the Thames, was found to be an agreeable variety in
nautical sport, and very amusing.&nbsp; Therefore, two prizes
were offered at the Paris Regatta for a canoe chase, open to all
the &ldquo;peoples.&rdquo;&nbsp; Five French canoes entered, but
there was only one English canoeist ready in <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>his Rob Roy
to meet all comers (the Hon. A. F. Kinnaird).</p>
<p>The canoes were drawn up on land alongside each other, and
with their steins touching the lower step of the
&ldquo;Tribune&rdquo; or Grand Stand.&nbsp; It was curious to
observe the various positions taken up by the different men, as
each adopted what he thought was the best manner of
starting.&nbsp; One was at his boat&rsquo;s stern; another, at
the side, half carried his canoe, ready to be &ldquo;off;&rdquo;
another grasped the bow; while the most knowing paddler held the
end of his &ldquo;painter&rdquo; (or little rope) extended from
the bow as far as it would reach.</p>
<p>All dashed off together on being started, and ran with their
boats to the water.&nbsp; The Frenchmen soon got entangled
together by trying to get into their boats dry; but the
Englishman had made up his mind for a wetting, and it might as
well come now, at once, as in a few minutes after, so he rushed
straight into the river up to his waist, and therefore being free
from the crowding of others, he got into his boat all dripping
wet, but foremost of all, and then paddled swiftly away.&nbsp;
The rest soon followed; and all of them were making to the
flag-boat anchored a little way off, round which the canoes must
first make a turn.&nbsp; Here the Englishman, misled by the
various voices on shore telling him the (wrong) side he was to
take, lost all <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>the advantage of his start so that
all the six boats arrived at the flag-boat together, each
struggling to get round it, but locked with some other-opponent
in a general scramble.&nbsp; Next, their course was back to the
shore, where they jumped out and ran along, each one dragging his
boat round another flag on dry land, amid the cheers and laughter
of the dense group of spectators, who had evidently not
anticipated a contest so new in its kind, and so completely
visible from beginning to end.&nbsp; Again, dashing into the
water the little <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>struggling fleet paddled away to
another flag-boat, but not now in such close array.&nbsp; Some
stuck in the willows or rushes, or were overturned and had to
swim; and the chance of who might win was still open to the man
of strength and spirit, with reasonably good luck.&nbsp; Once
more the competing canoes came swiftly back to shore, and were
dragged round the flag, and another time paddled round the
flag-boat; and now he was to be winner who could first reach the
shore again and bring his canoe to the Tribune: a well-earned
victory, won by the Hon. A. F. Kinnaird, far ahead of the
rest.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The whole affair lasted not much longer than might be required
to write its history; but the strain was severe upon pluck and
muscle, and called forth several qualities very useful in life at
sea, but which mere rowing in a straight race does not require
and cannot therefore exhibit.&nbsp; Instantly after this exciting
contest, a Frenchman challenged the winner to another chase over
the same course.&nbsp; But as the challenger had not thought fit
to enter the lists and test his powers in the chase, which was
open to him like the rest, it would, of course, have been quite
unfair to allow him, quite fresh, to have a special race with the
hard-worked winner, though the Englishman was at once ready to
accept the gage.</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>Among the visitors to the regatta was M. Forcat, whose
peculiar system of propelling boats I have mentioned in the
account of a former voyage; and he brought up for exhibition, and
for the practical trial by the winner of the canoe chase, a very
narrow and crank boat, rowed by oars jointed to a short mast in
front of the sitter, and thus obtaining one of the advantages
possessed by canoeists, that their faces are turned to the bow,
and so they see where they are going.</p>
<p>It is no doubt an enormous disadvantage that in ordinary
rowing your back is turned upon the course, with all its dangers
and beauties; and this inconvenience is only put up with because
you can go faster as you row with your back foremost, and the
scenery is of no account if a river serves only to float the
skiff but not to please the eye.&nbsp; As for travelling on new
and lovely waters in this style, with face to the stern, it is
just as if you were to walk backwards along a road, and to think
you could appreciate the picturesque either by a stare at the
retreating beauties you are leaving, or by a glance now and then
over your shoulder at what is coming.&nbsp; But though M.
Forcat&rsquo;s boat had the rower&rsquo;s face to the bow, the
form and size of the nondescript novelty were not to be
understood in a moment, and we tried to dissuade our young
canoeist from entering hastily a new sort <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>of boat,
very easily capsized.&nbsp; He had his own will, however, and his
own way, because he was a Scot, and only &ldquo;English&rdquo; in
the sense we use that word for &ldquo;British,&rdquo;&mdash;too
frequently thereby giving dire offence to the blue lion of the
North, whose armorial tail is so punctiliously correct as to the
precise curl and make up of its &ldquo;back hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s upset,&rdquo; they cried in a minute or
so.&nbsp; But we might well let so good a swimmer take his
chance; he merely pushed the boat ashore, and then took a
pleasant swim, until he was finally captured and put into the Rob
Roy&rsquo;s cabin, to change his wet clothes as well as a modest
man might do behind a plaid screen and before the curious
world.</p>
<p>Therefore in boats, as well as in business and politics, we
may learn lessons from one another, both on the water and on the
land: from Canada, as to the steering and the stroke; from
France, as to the fast, quick turning canoe in still water; and
from England, as to the <i>man</i>.</p>
<p>It was to see this regatta and to help in it that the Rob Roy
had pushed her way to Paris; and for this six hundred miles of
river navigation in a sea-going boat were justifiable, yet often
did I feel much the sea-trim lifeboat yawl was out of place upon
a calm inland water like the Seine.</p>
<p><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>Before the arrival of my little yacht, a challenge had
been sent to her to sail on the Seine against a French yacht
there.&nbsp; To this I replied that it would be scarcely a fair
match for the Rob Roy, a sea craft, to race on a river known only
to one of the competitors; but that the yawl would gladly sail a
match with any French yacht having only one man on
board,&mdash;the course to be at sea either one hundred miles for
speed, or one week for distance, and communication not allowed
with any other boat or shore.&nbsp; No answer came.</p>

<p>The Rob Roy was very pleasant lodgings when moved down to the
lovely bend at St. Cloud.&nbsp; Sometimes she was made fast to a
tree, and the birds sung in my rigging, and gossamers spun webs
on the masts, and leaves fell on the deck.&nbsp; At other times
we struck the anchor into soft green grass, and left the boat for
the day, until at night, returning from where the merry rowers
dined so well in training, and after a pleasant and cool walk
&ldquo;home&rdquo; by the river side, there was the little yawl
all safe on a glassy pool, and her deck shining spangled with
dewdrops under the moon, and the cabin snug within,&mdash;airy
but no draughts, cool without chill, and brightly lighted up in a
moment, yet all so undisturbed, without dust or din, and without
any bill to pay.</p>
<p><!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Awake with the earliest sun, there was always the same
sound alongside as we lay at anchor.&nbsp; The sweet murmurings
of the water running by, cleft by my sharp bow, and gliding in
wavelets along the smooth sides only a few inches from my ear,
and sounding with articulate distinctness through the tight
mahogany skin; and then there was the muttering chatter of the
amateur fisherman, who was sure to be at his post, however
early.</p>
<p>This respectable personage, not young but still hearty, is in
his own boat,&mdash;a boat perfectly respectable too, and well
found in all particulars, flat, brown, broad, utterly useless for
anything but this its duty every morning.</p>
<p>Quietly his anchor is dropped, and he then fixes a pole into
the bottom of the river, and lashes the boat to that, and to that
it will be fixed until nine o&rsquo;clock; at present it is
five.&nbsp; He puts on a grey coat, and brown hat, and blue
spectacles, all the colours of man and boat being philosophically
arranged, and as part of a complicated and secret plot upon the
liberties of that unseen, mysterious, and much-considered
<i>goujon</i> which is poetically imagined to be below.&nbsp; It
has baffled all designs for this last week, for it is a wily
monster, but <i>this</i> morning it is most certainly to be
snared.</p>
<p>Rod, line, float, hook, bait, are all prepared for <!-- page
140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>the conflict, and the fisherman now seats himself
steadily in a sort of arm-chair, and with stealth and gravity
drops the deceitful line into hidden deeps.&nbsp; At that float
he will stare till he cannot see.&nbsp; He looks contented; at
any rate, no muscle moves in his face, though envy may be
corroding his soul.&nbsp; After an hour he <i>may</i> just yield
so much as to mutter some few sounds, or a suppressed moaning
over his hard lot, &lsquo;and that is what I hear in my
cabin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then at last he rises with a determined
briskness in his mien, and the resentment against fate from an
ill-used man, and he casts exactly three handfuls of corn or
bread-crumbs into the water, these to beguile the reluctant
obstinate gudgeon, who, perhaps, poor thing, is not so much to
blame for inattention after all, being at the time just one
hundred and fifty yards away, beside those bulrushes.</p>
<p>Indeed that very idea seems to have struck the fisherman too,
and he marks the likely spot, and will go there to-morrow, not
to-day&mdash;no, he will always stick one day at one place.&nbsp;
How he moves to or from it I do not know, for the man and boat
had always come before I saw them, and I never stopped long
enough to see them depart.&nbsp; Four men fished four mornings
thus, and only two fish were caught by them in my presence.</p>
<p>The regatta is over, and Nadar&rsquo;s balloon is in <!-- page
141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>the sky, but seeming no bigger than other balloons, so
soon does the mind fail to appreciate positive size when the
object you look at is seen alone.&nbsp; It is the old story of
the moon, which &ldquo;looks as large as a soup-plate,&rdquo; and
yet Nadar&rsquo;s <i>G&eacute;ant</i> was the largest balloon
ever seen, and it carries a house below it instead of a
car&mdash;a veritable house, with two storeys, and doors and
windows.&nbsp; The freedom of its motion sailing away reminds me
that the Rob Roy ought to be moving too,&mdash;that she was not
built to dabble about on rivers, but to charge the crested wave;
and, indeed, there was always a sensation of being pent up when
she was merely floating near the inland cornfields, and so far
from the salt green sea; and this, too, even though pleasant
parties of ladies were on board, and boys got jaunts and cruises
from me, which I am certain pleased them much; still the
reef-points on her sails rattled impatiently for real breezes and
the curl of the surf, while the storm mizen was growing musty, so
long stowed away unused.</p>
<p>Next day, therefore, the Blue Peter was flying at the fore,
and the Rob Roy&rsquo;s cellar had its sea stock laid in from
&ldquo;Spiers and Pond,&rdquo; of ale, and brandy, and
wine.&nbsp; Before a fine fresh wind, with rain pelting
cheerfully on my back, we scudded down the Seine.&nbsp; To sail
thus along a <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>rapid stream with many barges to
meet, and trees overhanging, and shoals at various depths below,
is a very capital exercise, especially if you feel your honour at
stake about getting aground, however harmless that would
be.&nbsp; But the Seine has greater difficulties here, because
the numerous bridges each will present an obstacle which must be
dealt with at once, and yet each particular bridge will have its
special features and difficulties, not perhaps recognized when
first you meet them so suddenly. <a name="citation142"></a><a
href="#footnote142" class="citation">[142]</a>&nbsp; The bridges
on the Seine were often not high enough to allow the yawl to pass
under, except in the centre, or within a few feet on one side or
other of the keystone, and as the wind is deflected by the
bridge, just at the critical moment when you reach such places,
and the current of water below rushes about in eddies from the
piers, there is quite enough of excitement to keep a captain
pretty well awake in beating to windward through these bridges;
for the wind <i>must</i> be dead ahead a great part of the time,
because the river bends <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>about and
about with more and sharper turns than almost any other of the
kind.</p>
<p>Though sun and wind had varnished my face to the proper
regulation hue, in perfect keeping with a mahogany boat, yet the
fortnight of fresh water had softened that hardiness of system
acquired in real sea.&nbsp; My hands had gradually discarded, one
after another, the islands of sticking-plaister, and a whole
geography of bumps and bruises, which once had looked as if no
gloves ever could get on again&mdash;or rather as if the hands
must always be encased in gloves to be anywhere admissible in a
white-skinned country.</p>
<p>But now once again outward bound, though still so many miles
from the iodine scent of the open sea, and the gracious odour of
real ship&rsquo;s tar, one&rsquo;s nerves are strung tight in a
moment.&nbsp; The change was hailed with joy, though sudden
enough, from the glassy pond-like water at St. Cloud, lulled only
by gentle catspaws, half asleep and dreaming, to the rattling of
spars and blocks, and hissing of the water, in the merry
whistling gale by which we now were rapt away.</p>
<p>At Argenteuil there are numerous French pleasure-boats, and
the Rob Roy ran into a good berth.&nbsp; Next day there was a
downright gale, so I actually had to reef before starting,
because in a narrow river the work of beating against the <!--
page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>wind is very severe on legs and arms, and especially on
one&rsquo;s hands, unless they are hardened, and kept hard, too,
by constant handling of the strong ropes.</p>
<p>At length we put into a quiet bay, where the river Oise joined
the Seine, and we moored snugly under the lee of a green meadow,
while trees were above waving and rustling in the breeze.&nbsp;
It was far from houses, for I wished to have a good rest, as the
tossing of the former night had almost banished sleep.</p>
<p>But soon the inquisitive natives found the yawl in her
hiding-place, and they sat on the grass gazing by the hour.&nbsp;
The surroundings were so much like a canoe voyage, that I felt
more strongly than ever the confinement to a river, while the sea
would have been so open and grand under such a breeze.&nbsp;
Therefore I gave up all idea of sailing down the Seine any more,
and decided to get towed to Havre, and to launch out fairly on
our proper element once more.</p>
<p>Yet it was fine fun to row about in the dingey, and to
discover a quaint old inn, and to haul ashore my tiny cockleshell
and dine.&nbsp; Here they were certainly an uncouth set, they did
not even put a cloth on the table, nor any substitute for
it,&mdash;a state of things seen very seldom indeed in the very
outermost corners of my various trips.</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>Faithful promise was made by a man that he would rouse
me from slumber in my cabin under the haybank at the passing of
the next steamer, be it light or dark at the time.&nbsp; The
shriek of the whistle came in the first hours of morning, and the
man ran to tell it, with one side of his face shaven, and the
other frothed over with lather.</p>
<p>Being towed down is so like being towed up the river, that we
need merely allude to a few features in the voyage westward.</p>
<p>At one pretty town we stopped to unload cargo for some hours,
and I climbed the hills, scaled the old castle walls, and dived
into curious tumbledown streets.&nbsp; The keeper of the
newspaper-shop confessed to me his own peculiar grievance,
namely, that he often sent money to England in reply to quack
advertisements, but never had any reply.&nbsp; He seemed to be
too &ldquo;<i>poli</i>&rdquo; to credit my assertion that there
are &ldquo;many rogues in perfidious Albion,&rdquo; and on the
whole he was scarcely shaken in the determination to persevere in
filling their pockets, though he might empty his own.</p>
<p>An old man at a lock was delighted by a New Testament given to
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what this is; it is Protestant
prayers.&nbsp; Oh, they are good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he brought
his wife and his grandchildren, and every one of them shook
hands.</p>
<p>It was not very easy to get one&rsquo;s sea-stores replenished
<!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>in the continuous run down the Seine.&nbsp; Sometimes I
saw a milkman trundling his wheelbarrow over a bridge, and,
jumping on shore, I waylaid him for the precious luxury, or sent
off a boy for bread, and butter, and eggs; but, of course, the
times of eating had nothing to do with any hours, or recurring
seasons for a meal: you must cook when you can, and snatch a
morsel here or there, in a lock or a long reach of the
stream.&nbsp; At night the full moon sailed on high, and the crew
lay down with their faces over the steamer&rsquo;s side,
chattering with their English comrade till it was far past
bed-time, for we shall be off at three to-morrow morning.</p>
<p>The steam in the boiler first warns of the coming bustle as
its great bubbles burst inside, and rattle the iron plates.&nbsp;
Then, being more frequent and tighter bound, they give out a low
moaning, hidden rumble; and if the boat touches the side of the
steamer, there is a strong vibration through all her sonorous
planks, until some tap is turned in the engine, and the rush of
steam leaps into the cylinder as if indignant at its long
restraint.&nbsp; You had better get up now (there is no dressing,
for the simple reason that there has been no undressing), and in
two minutes you are fresh and hearty, though it is only a few
hours since you dropped to rest.</p>
<p><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Rouen looks as if it would be all that is pleasant for
a sailing-boat to rest in.&nbsp; Never was a greater
deception.&nbsp; It is difficult to find an anchorage, and
impossible to get a quiet berth by the quay.&nbsp; The bustle all
day, and the noise all night, keep you ever on the tenterhooks;
though, as these discomforts are caused by the active commerce of
the port, one ought to bear them patiently.</p>
<p>In one of the numerous <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;es</i> of barges,
boats, and steamers whirling round and round, amid entangled
hawsers, and a swift stream, we had at last to invoke aid from
shore, and a number of willing loungers gladly hauled on my
rope.&nbsp; Some of these men, when I thanked them, said they had
more to thank me for,&mdash;the books I had given them in my
voyage up.&nbsp; Still, with all this aid, the Rob Roy was
inextricably entangled with other heavier craft, and, in shoving
her off I tumbled overboard, and had to put up with a thorough
wetting; so, after a warm bath ashore, more <i>&agrave; la
mode</i>, I returned to my little cabin for a profound sleep.</p>
<p>Rain, almost ceaseless for a whole day and night, had searched
the smallest chink, and trickled ungraciously into my very
bed-room.&nbsp; But I suspended an iron tea-cup in the dark just
over my body, so <i>that</i> one little stream was
intercepted.&nbsp; This was the first really hard pressure <!--
page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>of wet on the Rob Roy, and all the defects it brought
to light were entirely remedied afterwards at Cowes.</p>
<p>On each of the four preceding nights I had been aroused for
the next day&rsquo;s work at three, or two, or even one
o&rsquo;clock, in the dark, and yet for one night more there was
to be no regular repose.</p>
<p>My mast had been made fast to the quay wall, but in
forgetfulness that on a tidal river this fastening must be such
as to allow for several feet of fall as the water ebbs.&nbsp;
Therefore, about the inevitable hour of one o&rsquo;clock, in the
dark, there was a loud and ominous crack and jerk from the rope,
and I knew too well the cause.&nbsp; In the rainy night it was a
troublesome business to arrange matters, and next day was a
drowsy one with me, spent in the strange old streets of the
town.</p>
<p>The policeman had orders to call me at any hour when a steamer
went by, and, being hooked at last to the powerful twin-screw
<i>Du Tremblay</i>, with a pleasant captain, I rejoiced to near
the very last bridge on the river, with the feeling at heart,
&ldquo;After this we are done with fresh-water
sailing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a suspension-bridge, and the worthy captain forgot all
about the Rob Roy and her mast, when he steered for a low part,
where his own funnel could pass because it was lowered, but where
I saw in a moment my mast must strike.</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>There was no time to call out, nor would it have
availed even to chop the towing-line with my axe, for the boat
had too much &ldquo;way&rdquo; on her to stop.&nbsp; Therefore I
could only duck down into the well, to avoid the falling spars
and the splinters.</p>
<p>The bridge struck the mast about two feet from the top, and,
instead of its breaking off with a short snap, the mast bent back
and back at least four feet just as if it were a fishing rod, to
my great amazement.&nbsp; The strong vibration of its truck
(<i>pomme</i> the French call it), throbbed every nerve of boat
and man, as it scraped over each plank above, and then the mast
sprang up free from the bridge with such a switch, that it burst
the lashings of both the iron shrouds merely by this rebound.</p>
<p>Now was felt the congratulation that we had carefully secured
a first-rate mast for the Rob Roy, one of the pieces of Vancouver
wood, proved, by the competitions lately held, to be the
strongest of all timber.</p>
<p>The moments of expected disaster and of happy relief were
vivid as they passed, but I made the steamer stop, and on
climbing the mast, I found not even the slightest crack or injury
there.&nbsp; Henceforth we shall trust the goodly spar in any
gale, with the confidence only to be had by a crucial test like
this.</p>
<p>As we shall soon be at sea again, but the river <!-- page
150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>is
calm enough here, perhaps this will be a fit opportunity for the
reader to peep into Rob Roy&rsquo;s cave as it was usually made
up for the night.</p>
<p>The floor of the cabin is made of thin mahogany boards,
resting on cross-beams.&nbsp; The boards are loose, so that even
in bed I can pull one up, and thus get at my cellar or at the
iron pigs of ballast.&nbsp; The bed is of cork, about seven feet
long and three feet wide.&nbsp; On this (for it <i>was</i> rather
hardish) I put a plaid, <a name="citation150"></a><a
href="#footnote150" class="citation">[150]</a> and then a railway
rug, which being coloured, had been substituted for a blanket, as
the white wool of the latter insisted on coming off, and gave an
untidy look to my thick blue boating-jacket.</p>
<p>One fold of the rug was enough for an ample covering, and I
never once was cold in the cabin.</p>
<p>A large pillow was encased by day in blue (the uniform colour
of all my decorations), and it was stripped at night to be soft
and smooth for the cheek of the sleeper.</p>
<p>Putting under this my coats and a regulation woven Jersey,
with the yacht&rsquo;s name worked in red across its breast in
regular sailor&rsquo;s fashion, the pillow became a most
comfortable cushion, and the woodcut shows me reclining in the
best <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span

if on a good sofa.&nbsp; On my right hand behind is a
candle-lamp, with a very heavy stand.&nbsp; It rests upon a

<p>In the sketch already given at p. 41, there is a tarpaulin
spread over the well, and this was used on one occasion when we
had to cook in rain while at anchor. <a name="citation151"></a><a

152</span>On the same side, and below the boxes,
&ldquo;Tools&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eating,&rdquo; already mentioned,
are two large iron cases, labelled &ldquo;Prog,&rdquo;&mdash;a
brief announcement which vastly troubled the brains of several
French visitors, whose English etymology did not extend to such
curt terms.</p>
<p>In these heavy boxes are cases of preserved meats, soups, and
vegetables, and these I found perfectly satisfactory in every
respect, when procured at a proper place (Morel&rsquo;s in
Piccadilly).&nbsp; Here you can get little tin cases, holding
half a pint each and sealed up hermetically. <a
name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a></p>
<p>To cook one of these tins full&mdash;which, with <!-- page
153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>bread and wine is an ample dinner&mdash;you cut the top
circle with the lever-knife, but allowing it to be still attached
by a small part to the tin, and fold this lid part back for a
handle.</p>
<p>Then put the tin into a can of such a shape and size that it
has about half an inch of water all round the tin, but not
reaching too high up, else it may bubble over when boiling, and
as you can use salt water or muddy water for this water-jacket,
it will not do to sprinkle any of that inside the tin.</p>
<p>The can is then hung over the Rob Roy lamp, and in six minutes
the contents of the tin are quite hot.&nbsp; Soup takes less
time, and steak perhaps a little more, depending on the facility
of circulation of the materials in the tin and the amount of wind
moderating the heat.&nbsp; The preserved meat or soup has been
thoroughly cooked before it is sold, and it has sauce, gravy, and
vegetables, and the oxtail has joints, all properly mixed.&nbsp;
Therefore, in this speedy manner your dinner is prepared, and
indeed it will be smoking hot and ready before you can get the
table laid, and the &ldquo;things&rdquo; set out from the
pantry.</p>
<p>Concentrated soup I took also, but it has a tame flavour, so
it was put by for a famine time, which never came.&nbsp; As for
&ldquo;Liebig&rsquo;s Extract of Meat,&rdquo; you need not starve
while there is any left, but that is the most we can say in its
favour.</p>

<p>On the Seine there is a tide phenomenon, called the
<i>barre</i>, as in English rivers the <i>bore</i>, which, when
not provided for, is very dangerous, especially at spring
tides.&nbsp; The water then rushes up the narrowing funnel-shaped
estuary, in a broad and swelling wave, sometimes four feet high,
and this will sweep off even large vessels from their anchors,
and it causes many wrecks.</p>
<p>On a former occasion when I happened to be in this
neighbourhood, a high tide had been truly predicted by
astronomers, which would culminate at the little town of Caudebec
on the Seine, but would also rise higher than ever known before
on all the adjacent coasts.</p>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>The news of this coming wonder spread over France, and
there being then a lull in Europe as to revolutions, &amp;c.
(except, of course, the perennial revolution in Spain), the
<i>quidnuncs</i> of the provinces had to run to the coast for an
excitement.&nbsp; Excursion trains, and heavily-laden steamers
poured volumes of people into Caudebec, and many of them had
never seen salt sea before.&nbsp; At the fashionable bathing-town
of Trouville the sight was a strange one when thousands of
expectant observers paraded the soft white sand as the full moon
shone on a waveless sea, and the brilliant dresses of the ladies
coloured the beautiful tableau.</p>
<p>The tide flowed and flowed; it bubbled over the usual bounds
of the shore; it trickled into the bathing sheds; it swelled
still higher upon the trim-kept promenade, until it lapped the
highest point and then went gently down again.&nbsp; Eclipses and
tides are patent proofs to the people that physical science can
appeal to.&nbsp; The &ldquo;music of the spheres&rdquo; hath also
a true rhythm, &ldquo;There is neither speech nor language but
their voices are heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To escape this <i>barre</i> on the Seine, our steamer anchored
by the quaint old town of Quilleb&oelig;uf with other vessels;
and, though the wind howled and the rain poured, the hill beside
us sheltered <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>all from its blasts, which were too
wild and powerful in the sea outside to allow us to proceed next
day. <a name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a></p>
<p>However, our Seine pilot pointed to an English steamer
&ldquo;which dared not go out;&rdquo; so any remonstrance on the
subject was silenced, and then he boldly asked if I would like a
pilot on board the Rob Roy (towed by the steamer all the time),
and I had sufficient command of countenance to decline with due
gravity.&nbsp; Better, perhaps, it would have been for me not to
carry then so much of the John Bull into these strange waters, as
will be seen from what occurred that night.</p>
<p>The tide rushed up with extraordinary strength, until it was
quite full.&nbsp; Then it paused for five minutes, and again it
set off in the opposite direction with the same fury, increased,
too, by the stream and the wind being also down the river.</p>
<p>At each of these changes every vessel, of course, swung round
to its anchor, and so must have loosened its hold, while all the
water picture changed from right to left like a scene shifted on
the stage.&nbsp; During this short interval of quiet you could
row ashore, but to get back again was almost <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>impossible
when the full torrent of water ran in straight.</p>
<p>As night came on I noticed that our steamer&rsquo;s anchor was
dragging, and that other steam vessels, more on the alert, were
easing the strain on their cables by working their engines at
half power all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, we are dragging anchor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are
mistaken.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure we are dragging: I have
watched for ten minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir, I am
certain we do not drag.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said this with such
firmness, that I confidingly believed it, and turned into
bed.</p>
<p>But it was not to sleep, except in fitful snatches.&nbsp; The
sound of the water hurrying by my side, like a mill race, and
within a few inches of my ear, had a strange and unwonted effect,
not now to soothe, but to drive sleep away.&nbsp; Bits of wood
and other <i>d&eacute;bris</i> often struck my mahogany
sounding-board with a loud thump, until I became accustomed even
to this, and was in a dreamy dozing about one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Then there came a new noise,&mdash;a low, steady rap, tap,
tap, tap, on the boat, and from underneath.&nbsp; For a moment or
two there was a sensation without apprehension,&mdash;a sort of
mesmeric, irresistible spell; but a sudden thought burst through
the trance, and with a powerful impression of <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>what was
doing&mdash;one no less horrid than true&mdash;I dashed off
covering, roof, hatchway, and all, and stood upon deck to meet a
terrible scene.</p>
<p>Our steamer had drifted in the dark until we closed upon
another steamboat astern.&nbsp; My yawl, tied to the stern of
one, was between that and the bows of the other, the anchor chain
of which had already got underneath the waist of the Rob Roy, and
had been ringing the rap, tap, tap of a warning that undoubtedly
saved her life.&nbsp; Light flashed from the riding lamp at the
steamer&rsquo;s bow full on my boat&rsquo;s deck, which was now
heeled over deeply until the dark water rushed through her
gunwale; it seemed that only a few seconds more and the poor
little yawl would sink in the flood, or be ground into splinters
by the two great iron monsters nearing each instant in the
dark.</p>
<p>All this was noticed in the same rapid glance which in such
dangers grasps a whole scene in a moment and stamps it in the
mind for years.</p>
<p>My boat hung on the cold iron chain, yet it wavered with equal
poise to go this way or that.&nbsp; If she could be swerved to
the stern she might possibly escape destruction, but if to the
other side, then the strong rope at her bow would entirely
prevent her escape.&nbsp; With a loud shout to arouse the crews I
put every atom of bodily <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>force into
one strenuous shove, straining nerve and muscle in the desperate
effort until I could not see.&nbsp; She trembled and
surged&mdash;it was successful, and I fell into the water, but my
yawl was saved. <a name="citation159a"></a><a
href="#footnote159a" class="citation">[159a]</a></p>
<p>Crash came the two steamers together.&nbsp; I heeded nothing
of their din and smashing, and the uproar of the men, but I
scrambled all wet into my cabin, nervously shaking with
excitement and a chattering of teeth.&nbsp; Then I sat down to
sum up my bruises,&mdash;a barked shin, sprained thigh, and
bleeding cheek-bone; and a hapless object I must have seemed,
bathing, by turns, my leg, and shin, and face, from a brandy
bottle, and then a gulp inside.&nbsp; In a survey of the yawl
made next day, there was to be seen (as still there is) the marks
of the iron chain-links deeply impressed in the mahogany planks
of her waist.&nbsp; The piece of wood that bears these mementoes
of that night&rsquo;s deed might well be cut out and kept as a
curious memorial.&nbsp; The bowsprit also was found to have been
nipped at the end (though it had been drawn in close to the
stem), and the squeeze had quite flattened the strong iron ring
upon it, and jammed up the wood into a pulp as if it were cork.
<a name="citation159b"></a><a href="#footnote159b"
class="citation">[159b]</a></p>
<p>The weather did not moderate next day, but we <!-- page
160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>started nevertheless, and when the waves of the wider
sea were tumbling in I expected to have a wetting as in passing
here before; but the sea was in fine long swells, and so the yawl
rode over them buoyantly.&nbsp; Also the large twin-screw tugboat
is far more pleasant to follow than the smaller steamer with its
two paddle-wheels, one at each side of the stern. <a
name="citation160"></a><a href="#footnote160"
class="citation">[160]</a></p>
<p>In another way also I managed better than before while
undergoing the process of being towed.&nbsp; I set the hatch of
the well in front of me, and then allowed the reflection of the
funnel of the steamer upon the wet deck of my boat to be seen
through a chink, while my head and body were entirely concealed
and completely sheltered from spray.</p>
<p>Now, having marked where this reflection rested, when I was
exactly in a proper line abaft the steamer, I was enabled to
steer altogether by the shadowy image, although I could not see
the object itself to which I was directing the bow of my
boat.&nbsp; The captain and crew of the steamer <!-- page
161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>were very much astonished with this proceeding. <a
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a></p>
<p>Arriving at Havre on July 21, there was need for a good rest,
and the port was suited for it.&nbsp; There is quiet water in a
sequestered nook of the harbour and plenty of amusement on
shore.&nbsp; Havre, too, was in a state of much excitement, for
the Empress was about to embark thence for England, and the
Imperial yacht was in the basin, with a splendid crew on
board.&nbsp; In the evening the Emperor also came to the town, to
escort his wife when she embarked, and as his carriage drove past
the crowd ran after it hallooing.</p>
<p>The last time I had seen the Empress Eugenie was under
somewhat peculiar circumstances; she was floating in the sea, and
we shall tell more of her Majesty afloat in a future page, when
fair bathers at Margate appear.</p>
<p><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>The beautiful English yacht &lsquo;Vindex&rsquo; was on
the gridiron with the Rob Roy; that is to say, on a sunk stage of
wood, on which you can place a vessel, if it is desired to
examine or repair its hull and keel when the tide leaves it there
dry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vindex&rsquo; had come to the Havre Regatta, and as she
had won the prize there in the previous year a great deal of
interest was shown about her now.&nbsp; But the regatta on this
occasion was by no means interesting, for the wind fell into
calm, and it was merely a drifting match.</p>
<p>My usual visits in the dingey had disposed of nearly all my
store of French books and periodicals, and the remainder we took
to a civil bookseller, from whom we bought French charts and a
Pilot book of the English south coast soundings.</p>
<p>Meantime, after a rest and refreshment to my crew, a thorough
scraping to my boat, and a good stock laid in of comfort for my
voyage to England, the question had to be distinctly put,
&ldquo;How am I to get over the broad Channel to the Isle of
Wight?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, of course, impossible to think of
coming back as we had gone,&mdash;that is, along the French
coast.&nbsp; This would never do.&nbsp; Again, it was also found
that the steamers were not allowed to tow any boat to sea behind
the passenger vessels unless in cases of distress, so that put an
<!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>end to another solution of the problem, which was to
get half way by towing and then to cast off and sail.</p>
<p>Well, shall I get an additional hand on board?&nbsp; But where
is he to sit if it blows hard?&nbsp; And if it does not blow
hard, what is the use of him?&nbsp; In fact I was steadily
driven, as if by severe logic, to the conclusion already at the
bottom of my mind, to <i>sail right across alone</i>.</p>
<p>Then I asked one or two experienced sailors if they thought
the Rob Roy could do it, and they said, &ldquo;Yes, she can; but
can <i>you</i>?&nbsp; You may be three or four days out, and can
you stand the fatigue?&nbsp; At any rate, do not start in a
southwest wind: it raises a sea and the up and down of the waves
will tire you soon in a long day&rsquo;s work, and then there is
the night besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having retired to my calm little creek, where the yawl was
tied by a line to a large fishing-smack, I tried to read, but
very soon found I was thinking of anything but the words on the
printed page; then to sleep; but still I was musing on the
prospect now opened of a hazardous and delightful sail.</p>
<p>About one o&rsquo;clock I gazed out moodily on the quiet night
scene of the harbour, sleeping around.&nbsp; Tall masts whitened
by the moon, black hulls darkened in the shade, busy quays
silent, long-necked <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>iron cranes peering into the deep
water that reflected quaint leaning houses, all distorted, and
big buoys magnified by the haze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why continue this anxiety about how to get over?&nbsp;
See the clouds drift over the clear moon with an east wind.&nbsp;
Will it ever be easier than now?&nbsp; I cannot sleep&mdash;why
not start this moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once the decision was made, all was alert on the Rob Roy; and
in half an hour I had breakfasted, and then very noiselessly
loosed the thin line that bound us to the quay, and bid
&ldquo;adieu to France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every single thing we could think of was perfectly
prepared.&nbsp; The sails were all ready to set, but we had to
row the yawl slowly into the main harbour, and there we met a low
round swell coining in from the sea.&nbsp; We tugged hard to
force her against the adverse tide, but progress was tediously
slow.&nbsp; Presently some fishing luggers were getting under
way, and soon the usual clatter and din of the French sailors, at
full tide, rang forth as if by a magic call at two in the
morning.</p>
<p>After shouting some time for a boat to tow me to the
pier-head, at last one came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten francs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you eight;&rdquo; and after parley the
two <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>men in their little boat agreed to
take the Rob Roy in tow.</p>
<p>Almost immediately I noticed that the moon was hid, and the
wind had chopped round to the southwest, the very wind I was told
not to start with, but now&mdash;well it was too late to
withdraw, and so we laboured on, while the great clumsy luggers
crossed and recrossed our course, and frequently dashed upon the
piles of the pier in the stupidest manner, with much loud roaring
of voices, and creaking of spars, and fluttering of sails.</p>
<p>Presently the men called out that, as the sea was getting
higher, I had better pay them the money.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I said; but, alas!&nbsp; I could find
only five francs of change, the rest being napoleons.</p>
<p>They shouted, &ldquo;Give us gold&mdash;we will send the
change to England;&rdquo; but I bellowed out a better plan, to
give them an order on the yacht agents at Havre for five francs,
and the silver besides.</p>
<p>Finally this was accepted, so I got out paper and envelope,
and on the wet deck, by moonlight, wrote the banker&rsquo;s
draft.</p>
<p>When they came near the harbour&rsquo;s mouth, they sung out
&ldquo;Get ready your mizen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoist;&rdquo; and so up went the trim little sail, glad
to flap once more in salt air.&nbsp; Then they <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>bid me
&ldquo;Get ready your jib&mdash;we have cast you off;
hoist!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, and I did hoist.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reader may recollect that the end of my bowsprit
had been squeezed by a collision, and was in fact as weak as a
charred stick.&nbsp; But I had entirely forgotten this by some
unaccountable fatality, during the three days at Havre, when it
might have been easily repaired.</p>
<p>The moment therefore I had hoisted the jib, the bowsprit end
broke sharp off into a ragged stump, and the jib instantly flew
away into the air just like an umbrella blown inside out.</p>
<p>This was of course a most critical time for such a mishap,
with a strong breeze dead ahead, driving me in upon piles, and a
tumbling sea, and numerous large luggers sailing about me in the
dark.&nbsp; Therefore I felt that this unlucky accident and the
southwest wind meant, &ldquo;I must not go out to-night.&nbsp; It
will not do to begin a voyage of a hundred miles with a broken
bowsprit.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p167b.jpg">
<img alt=
"For a hundred miles"
title=
"For a hundred miles"
src="images/p167s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>All this prudent reasoning was at once cut short by the
Frenchmen calling out, &ldquo;<i>Voulez-vous sortir encore</i>,
<i>monsieur</i>?&rdquo; and the Rob Roy thus hailed could make
but one reply, &ldquo;<i>Oui</i>, <i>oui</i>,
<i>certainement</i>;&rdquo; so I bid them lay hold again while I
captured the truant jib, hauled down and reefed it, and made it
fast to the stem, and then again &ldquo;<i>Lachez
tous</i>,&rdquo; we are free on the rolling waves.</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>At the worst, methought, we can return in four or five
hours, when the tide falls, if we find it unadvisable to go on;
but meanwhile our yawl shot away westward to get a good offing
from the Cape de la H&egrave;ve, and then I cooked breakfast (the
former one counted of course in the former day, according to the
excellent rule already explained), and about half-past four I
laid on my straight course to old England, with a capital breeze
on my quarter, and a hundred times glad that I had not gone
back.</p>
<h2><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span

<p class="gutsumm">Nodding&mdash;Prancing&mdash;First
Thoughts&mdash;England&mdash;Mid-channel
thoughts&mdash;Battle&mdash;Religion&mdash;Science&mdash;Church&mdash;Guide.</p>
<p>Up rose the sun, and all was cheerful.&nbsp; Then I laid her
to, and got out my axe, and chopped the bowsprit into shape, so
that it would run out further, and then set the whole jib firmly
on it.</p>
<p>All the feelings restrained so long by the river work, and
regatta amenities, and Exhibition in Paris, now came forth
powerfully in a flow of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Boys seem to like the stories of the canoe voyages, and
perhaps they will read this one of the yawl.&nbsp; If they have a
sailor turn, they will imagine the new pleasure to be felt when
you glide away from a fast-retreating land, and nothing is in
front but sea, sea, sea.&nbsp; Then the little boat you are in,
and know in every plank, and love too, becomes more than ever
cherished as a friend.&nbsp; It is your only visible trust, and,
if it <i>is</i> a good <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>boat, you
trust it well, for indeed it seems to try its very best, like a
horse on the desert plain, that knows it must go on if it is ever
to get to the other side.&nbsp; Then as the cliffs, that looked
high behind you, dwindle into a line of deep blue, the compass by
your knees becomes a magic thing, with no tongue indeed to speak,
but surely a brain it must have to know the way so well.</p>
<p>For hours we went on thus in silent pleasure, gazing at the
gentle needle as it moved without noise; and, with nothing around
but plash of waves, bright sun, and a feeling of hot silence, the
spell of sleep was overpowering.&nbsp; Homer sometimes nodded, it
is said, and he would have certainly had a good nap had he
steered long thus.&nbsp; The sinking off into these delicious
slumbers was imperceptible, and perfectly beyond the will&rsquo;s
control.&nbsp; In a moment of trance I would be far away in
dreamland, and with a thousand incidents, all enacted in orderly
succession, with fights, wrecks, or pageantry, or the confused
picture of bright-coloured nothings which fancy paints on the
half-alive brain.</p>
<p>From these sweet dreams there was a rude awakening; a slap
from the sea on my face, as the yawl, untended, suddenly rounded
to, or a rattling taptoo on the deck when the jib-sheets found
they were free.</p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Then for a time I would resolutely insist upon
attention&mdash;every moment of slumber being a positive
wandering from the course; but no, the outer self that demands a
nap will not be denied by the inner nobler self that commands
alertness.</p>
<p>Only one single sea-gull did I see in thirty hours.&nbsp; One
vessel also far off was the sole break upon the painfully
straight horizon, and as the wind gradually died away into
nothing, the prospect did not improve.</p>
<p>Then came the up and down riding over seas without gaining a
yard, the &ldquo;prancing&rdquo; of the vessel which had galloped
forth in the morning like a horse in its first bounds on grass
when, leaving a hard road, its hoof paws gladly the springy
turf.</p>
<p>Some feelings that came up then from deep recesses in the mind
were new, but too new and unnamed to put in words.&nbsp; Alone on
the waters, when you cannot see land, is a strange
condition.&nbsp; However, if only fog or darkness hides the land
you still feel that land is there.&nbsp; Quite another thing is
it to be afloat alone, where, because it is fifty miles away,
land <i>cannot</i> be seen.&nbsp; Doubtless it may seem foolish,
but I am not able to tell the feelings of that time.</p>
<p>Becalmed midway between France and England, it was natural for
the mind to think of both <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>countries,
and every time I have left France it has been with more
admiration of that lively land; <a name="citation171"></a><a
href="#footnote171" class="citation">[171]</a> but Frenchmen,
during this visit, looked at by us for the twentieth time, had
evident signs of wounded vanity: they were conscious of playing
second fiddle in a grand German opera.</p>
<p>Thinking of England, on the other hand, religion and not
politics became the theme; for is not religion at least more
considered amongst us than ever before?&nbsp; It may be opposed
or misapprehended or derided, but it is not ignored as it used to
be.</p>
<p>Look at the three leading newspapers, the morning, the
evening, and the weekly registers of the direction, warmth, and
pressure of public thought, as noted by keen observers, who are
shrewd and weatherwise as to the signs of the times, and are
seldom wrong when they hoist a storm signal.&nbsp; More and more
each of these <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>secular papers occupies its best
columns with religious questions, and not with the mere facts or
gossip on the subject, or with records of philanthropy, important
as these are, but with deep essential doctrines, and prolonged
arguments about the very kernel of truth.</p>
<p>Religion is allowed to have a place now in every stratum of
society, even if a wrong place and a very uncomfortable place for
a slender religion, though sometimes, indeed, a politician
laments that &ldquo;Parliament has its time occupied by the
subject,&rdquo; as if it were possible for the House to settle
the Church and the School and the homes of men, without also
considering their religion.</p>
<p>And if almost each family gives some place or other to it, so
perhaps no one man in England would allow any other man to say of
him that he has &ldquo;nothing to do with religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Religion is more present among us; but this is a wide
term&mdash;&lsquo;religion.&rsquo;&nbsp; If there is a God, then
that there is a revealed religion is acknowledged, and that the
Christian religion has the best, if not the only claims to be
this.&nbsp; Who is to decide for me as to whether there is a
God?</p>
<p>If ignorance unfits me to judge this rightly, does not class
prejudice unfit others to be the arbiters?</p>
<p>Are not the official exponents of theology liable <!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>to
be prejudiced in its favour as something that establishes or
enhances the position of their order among men?</p>
<p>Are not the votaries of natural science subject to a prejudice
against Theism as something that dethrones them from
supremacy?</p>
<p>Is there not among these last a writhing invisible agony to
escape from the avowal that God governs?&nbsp; And why is
this?&nbsp; Perhaps because man proudly relishes freedom, and
hates to say that his life is inspected and controlled by another
Being who will also judge him hereafter; and because the student
of physical science knows that if there is a God, then moral
science must be a far nobler pursuit than his own pursuit, even
if it is less palpable and popular; also because the scientific
man is tempted to do all he can to ignore that anything is
outside the ken of science&mdash;that there is a Being on quite
another plane, far above him and his researches.</p>
<p>But science has no exclusive or even predominant right in the
decision of this matter; nor has it any solid success in the long
battle, though one or other in its ranks may triumph in a
skirmish.&nbsp; When one philosopher demolishes the Bible, an
ordinary man cannot convince him he is wrong.&nbsp; But when a
dozen savants tilt in the fray, even an ordinary man can see that
their weapons demolish each other, and the old Book stands.</p>
<p><!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>This geologist has scratched the varnish on the globe,
and forthwith frames his new theory of creation.&nbsp; In ten
years he is proved utterly wrong by that microscopist who has
detected animal remains in an igneous rock.&nbsp; The simple
bystander cannot understand either side, and far less tell which
side is true.&nbsp; But when the combatants slay each other, the
wayfaring man can understand this neutralization.&nbsp; The
philosopher strikes me with awe so long as he keeps aloft beyond
my knowledge or comprehension.&nbsp; When he comes down I can
love him, but the reverence of his mystery is gone, and he is
soon found out to be a brother mite.&nbsp; My friend can walk
faster and farther on earth than I can; but when he wades into
the water, I find I can swim just as well as he&mdash;while if we
try to fly in the air, neither of us can soar a yard.</p>
<p>Thus the mind that is great in observing, collating, and even
generalizing facts, gets immediately out of its depth a few feet
from land in the ocean of hypothesis, and it can be drowned there
like my own.</p>
<p>Reaching up higher, in search of First Cause, the clever brain
grasps the liquid &aelig;ther above, and yearns; but it holds
nothing, not one atom more than an ordinary mind; nor has all the
striving of all the world lifted one man a foot above the plain
towards heaven.</p>
<p><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>If these sentiments are pretentious, they show that one
can learn at least forwardness from philosophers, if not
wisdom.</p>
<p>But it is not the Atheist that puzzles one so much as those
who find it convenient to admit the one point to start
from&mdash;&ldquo;There is a God,&rdquo; be He styled in
redundant reverence, &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
vacuity behind that is too dark and abysmal to be a home for
their soul, and therefore they will accompany you thus far.</p>
<p>This short creed is long enough to cover many different
meanings, and elastic enough to be worn, at least outside, for
common decency, and to fit almost any form of life and
character.</p>
<p>Some men have never had more than this meagre garment.&nbsp;
Others have been swathed in more ample folds from the nursery,
but have stripped off the mental clothing of their childhood,
feeling it tight, or encumbered with braid and tassels, and some
have torn it all to tatters; but at last, as their inner being
chills in the air of naked freedom, they take upon them this
creed as the one general raiment of prudence.</p>
<p>There may be quiet in this creed, for a time, if not comfort;
but the garment fails to warm the heart if indeed it even covers
the head; and the mind soon wonders whether God can <i>be</i>,
and yet <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>not <i>do</i>, and it yearns to know
what God has said and done.&nbsp; Instinct tells it that to know
the very truth upon this will make the man&rsquo;s creed a
vascular body for action, not a mere decent clothing.&nbsp; The
mind begins its search for this truth on a battle-field.&nbsp; It
is a fight for peace as well as a search for treasure.&nbsp;
Facts have to be settled, in hot conflict, which are felt to
touch every point of life, and not mere fancies high in the air,
or thoughts too deep for common people.&nbsp; Each man fights
hand-to-hand here.&nbsp; Strategy and leaders avail not.&nbsp;
Mere numbers on one side or the other do not count for individual
conviction; we are not saved in bundles.</p>
<p>No man can keep out of reach of the turmoil, though many would
be content to remain as bystanders, secure from remark or
disturbance, in a hazy cloud where the only thing distinct is
their denial that there is anything definite.&nbsp; Their creed
is not strengthened by its being vague and curtailed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Moral sense,&rdquo; &ldquo;intuitive truth,&rdquo;
&ldquo;general utility&rdquo;&mdash;their ultimate
appeal&mdash;is just as far out of reach of algebraic logic as
any of the propositions are which they reject because these
cannot be proved thus.&nbsp; Try this scrimp creed by their own
standard of proof, and it shrivels away, until no God,&mdash;no
soul,&mdash;no being remains as absolutely demonstrated, and
there is only a <i>thing</i> faintly <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>conscious
of its own existence.&nbsp; In this watery element of dim, soft
fog, or hard cold ice, there is no rest for the soul.</p>
<p>There are others, again, who, frightened by the hurly-burly,
after a short wild wandering alone, join any group, as a refuge,
if it be only visible, and seek a Church as an asylum for the
timid rather than a fortress for the brave.</p>
<p>But what Church shall give rest, or which of them is even
quieter than the outer din?&nbsp; There is one, indeed, that,
long nursed and dozing in the lap of the State, is now roughly
shaken, but is she yet awake?&nbsp; She has grown in bulk at
least, while sleeping.&nbsp; Is she not like an overgrown child
too big to be carried, and too rickety to walk alone?</p>
<p>She is called National but is only Diocesan, with different
doctrine and worship in different dioceses.&nbsp; The bishops
meet, and thinking different, but trying to say the same, they
say what is unanimous only when it means nothing.&nbsp; The
clergy meet, but while some of them are true Ministers, others
would be as Presbyters towards their bishops and Popes to their
people.&nbsp; Each parish can wear the ribbons that are badges of
its doctrine.&nbsp; We are crystallizing into congregations, and
soon these will split into families, and so perhaps we shall get
back at last to the simple <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>old shape,
when the message was for Nymphas and &ldquo;the church which is
in his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, my life-borne bark must not founder for lack of a
guide.&nbsp; True, there is a chart, and precepts for the right
way are clear, but my craving is for a living Spirit within which
shall point me to the peaceful shore by an attraction powerful
and unerring, though unseen, and, like that of the needle,
incomprehensible.</p>
<p>And was it not the divinest act ever done by God to come down
Himself among men, saying, &ldquo;I am the Way,&rdquo; &ldquo;and
I will give you rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now we can safely steer, and will surely reach port.</p>

<p>See the sails are impatiently flapping.&nbsp; Each wave jerks
the mast and canvas with a smart loud crack like that of a
whip.&nbsp; The sound is unspeakably irritating, it seems so
useless and wanton, and so perfectly <i>de trop</i> while the
wind is absolutely calm.&nbsp; At other times, in such a case,
you can stop this provoking clatter by hauling up the boom and
lowering the jib; but here, in mid ocean, we must not hamper the
sails but be ready for the first faint breath of wind, and
moreover&mdash;best to confess it&mdash;I had in this case a
serious disturbance <i>within</i>, yet not mental.&nbsp;
Strawberries and cream imprisoned with mushrooms did not
agree.</p>
<p>They called them mushrooms in Havre yesterday, and we know
&ldquo;there are 371 edible fungi;&rdquo; but I assert that the
rebellious species embarked <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>with me
were toadstools, and so giddiness followed upon sleep . . .</p>
<p>Gentle and cool is the first fresh murmur of a new breeze as
it comes from afar, tripping along.&nbsp; Gratefully we watch its
footsteps on the sea.&nbsp; Its garments rustle in the south, and
the glassy rounded waves are now crested by its touch.&nbsp; Then
the coolness of it fans the cheek, the flag flutters while the
sails fill full, the mast bows gently under the soft pressure,
and the Rob Roy runs eagerly again upon her proper course.</p>
<p>Dinner was instantly served up to celebrate the event.&nbsp;
It is an Englishman&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; Still we were fifty miles
from England, but wave after wave rose, dashed, and was left
behind, till the sun got weary in his march, and hung, in the
west, a great red globe.&nbsp; My course had been taken for the
Nab light, which is in the entrance towards Portsmouth, but the
Channel tide, crossing my path twice, could carry the yawl fast,
yet secretly, first right, then left, and both ways once
again.</p>
<p>Yet when the evening shade fell we expected to see at least
some light in the horizon, for the English lights are clear, and
they shine out twenty miles to sea.&nbsp; How I peered into the
inscrutable darkness, and standing by the mast to get higher, but
in vain; yet still the wind urged on, and the sea tumbled forward
all in the right way.&nbsp; <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Hours
passed, and ship-lights now could be descried; they were crossing
my path, for they were in the great fair-way of nations bound
east or west through the Channel.&nbsp; This at least was
company, but it was also danger.&nbsp; We have left the lonely
plain, and are walking now in the street of waters; but how am I
to sleep here, and yet I <i>must</i> sleep this night.&nbsp; I
tried to &ldquo;speak&rdquo; a goodly vessel sailing past like a
shadow&mdash;I ventured even to near it&mdash;hailing, &ldquo;How
far to the Nab?&rdquo; but the voice melted in the breeze.&nbsp;
Low vapoury clouds began to rise from the sea; they looked like
dark trees around; but the stars were clear up above.&nbsp; It
was impossible not to feel as if land was there, yet, when my
lead was cast, the deep only laughed at its little reach
downward.</p>
<p>In such thick weather it will never do to ferret out the
channel to Cowes, even if we are near it.&nbsp; The night must be
passed at sea, and better begin to do that now than go in too
near the cliffs in darkness; and so we prepared to lie-to.&nbsp;
Lowering the main-sail I tried the yawl first under mizen and
jib; but the rolling in every trough of the waves was most
uncomfortable, and besides she drifted north, which might end by
going ashore.</p>
<p>Then I took in the jib and set the storm-mizen, and hung out
the anchor with twenty fathoms of chain&mdash;not, of course, to
reach the bottom, but to <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>keep the
boat&rsquo;s head easier in the sea, and this did perfectly
well.&nbsp; The motion was a long, regular rise and fall, and the
drift was to the east; quite out of our proper course, indeed,
but I couldn&rsquo;t help that.</p>
<p>The motion of a vessel lying-to is far more easy than what
would be supposed possible.&nbsp; When you are rocked in a boat
making progress by sails or steam, the pressure of each wave is
more or less of a blow, for the ship is going forward, and it
resists the mass of water often with violence.&nbsp; At anchor,
too, though in a modified degree, the action is the same, and in
a swell without wind the oscillations are jerky and short, for
they are not softened by the sails then merely hanging.&nbsp; But
if a boat is staunch and strong, and the deck is tight, and she
has plenty of keel, so as not to swerve round right and left, but
to preserve a general average direction towards the wind, then
she may lie-to in a very stiff gale and high sea with a
wonderfully gentle motion.&nbsp; Her head then is slightly off
the sea, and there is but little rolling.&nbsp; The sails are so
set that they ease every lateral heave.&nbsp; She forges forward
just a little between the wave tops, and when the crest of one
lifts her up she courteously yields for the time, but will soon
again recover lost ground by this well-managed
&ldquo;compromise.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>When we saw how admirably the Rob Roy behaved in
lying-to, and that scarcely a wave broke over her deck, we felt
that if it came to the worst we might thus pass a whole week in
her safely.</p>
<p>Now I must make my bed.&nbsp; Undoubtedly this was a risky
deed about to be done; but pray what else could we do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought not to have come there at all,&rdquo; may be
replied.</p>
<p>Say that to the huntsman who has got into a field with the
only way out of it over a chasm to leap.&nbsp; Tell it to the
mountain climber scrambling down, who pauses before a
<i>crevasse</i>; and do not forget to say the same to the poor
old fisherman overtaken in the midnight winter&rsquo;s gale with
his life in one hand and in the other a tangled net that has
caught the fried sole for your comfortable dinner.</p>
<p>It would not do of course to go into my cabin.&nbsp; In the
first place, the dingey was there, and then if I were to be
enclosed inside when anything like a &ldquo;run down&rdquo; had
to be dealt with, the cabin might be my coffin.</p>
<p>First I tried to crouch down in the well, but the constraint
on limbs and joints was unbearable.&nbsp; My head slept while my
knees ached with the pressure.&nbsp; No! there must be a positive
lying down to sleep, if the sleep is to give true refreshment
<!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>when you are rocked about on the waters; and this you
have no doubt been convinced of any time at sea.</p>
<p>The strange twists of body I tried to fit into comfortably
where the space (in the well) was only three feet each way,
reached at last to the grotesque&mdash;the absurd contortions of
a man miserable on a pleasure jaunt&mdash;and I laughed aloud,
but somehow it sounded hollow and uncanny.</p>
<p>As to the exact spot where the Rob Roy was at this particular
time we had of course no possible idea, but judging from after
circumstances, the position must have been about ten miles south
of St. Catherine&rsquo;s Head, and she drifted twenty miles east
while I dreamed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>One effect of extreme exhaustion is to make the mind almost
reckless of risk, and we can well understand how in some
shipwrecks, after days and nights without sleep, men are in a
placid, callous composure of sheer weariness, and that the last
agony of drowning then is nothing, just as Dr. Livingstone told
me, the shake given by a lion to his victim paralyses the whole
system before it is killed.&nbsp; Therefore, as danger was only
likely, and sleep was imperative, I must have sleep at all
hazards, and so we loosed out the folds of the main-sail on the
wet deck.&nbsp; How white and creamy they looked while all was
dark around, <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>for no moon had risen.&nbsp; Then I
put on my life-belt, and fastened the ship&rsquo;s light where it
would not swing, but rested quite close to the deck.&nbsp; I
rolled the thick, dry, and ample main-sail round me, stretching
my limbs in charming freedom, and I tied myself to the boom, so
as not to be easily jerked overboard by the waves.&nbsp; Of
course it was my firm intention to sleep only by winks of one eye
at a time; but the struggle with Morpheus was, we suspect,
<i>very</i> faint; at any rate no record remained but a few dim
visions that may have flickered in the soft vanishing of
consciousness.</p>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Can any person be expected to describe his first
feelings as he awakes in such a bed and finds it broad day?&nbsp;
Bright and glorious sun, high up, how I stared at you! and then a
glance to the side, and behold, there is
land&mdash;England.&nbsp; Deliberately I rose and gave three
hearty cheers&mdash;nobody there to hear, indeed, but
myself&mdash;no matter, it did good to me to cheer, and to hear
too.&nbsp; Breakfast was soon agoing.&nbsp; Ten hours&rsquo;
sleep had thoroughly refreshed me, mind and body; but I could not
make out what part of the coast we had hit upon.</p>
<p>It was still about twelve miles distant, and as there were no
cliffs in sight, it could not be the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; My
chart told nothing; my French Pilot-book had woodcut pictures of
all the coast, but nothing came of the search in these; and
whether we had drifted east or west of the Isle of Wight we
finally gave up as a question&mdash;we must go to the coast
itself and see.</p>
<p>Therefore we steered due north, rapidly nearing the unknown
land, and with a joyous morning, barometer high, wind south, and
a coming fine day.&nbsp; Presently there loomed on the horizon
one, and then another, and another, splendid ships of war.&nbsp;
They steamed in line, and I tried to intercept them to put the
query, &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;&nbsp; Baffled in this, the
puzzle was, &ldquo;Are they going <!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>to
Portsmouth or Plymouth?&rdquo;&nbsp; There were equally good
reasons for either.</p>
<p>At length three towns could be seen, and the pictures of the
French Pilot-book were closely examined, but several plates had
each three towns which would fit the case before me, one as well
as the other.&nbsp; Fortunately we chose the middle one of the
three, because it had a little lighthouse.&nbsp; That on the left
we found afterwards was Bognor, which has a reef of dangerous
rocks upon its shore.</p>
<p>A fisherman was in his boat, and I hailed him, &ldquo;Boat
ahoy!&nbsp; What is the name of that town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Town, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that village right ahead; what do you call
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The village there, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; what is its name?&nbsp; It has a name,
hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly, sir, it&rsquo;s got a
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is the name?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you come from, sir? from the
Wight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after these Scottish answers to the questions of a
Scotsman, at last I found my way into Littlehampton; and if ever
you go to the Beach Hotel in want of a soft bed, after sleeping
<!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>out of a bed for nearly a month, you will find it
there.</p>
<p>This little place, between Bognor and Brighton, is a quiet
bathing town just in the delicate stage of existence, when it has
been found out and admired, but not yet spoilt.&nbsp; One row of
houses fronts the sea with a fine grassy plain between, and a
clean white strand.</p>
<p>The Inn was of olden times, and apart near the water, with a
landlady of the good old English type; and her son, the waiter,
rampant about canoes, kept an aviary under the porch and a
capital swimming dog in the stable.</p>
<p>Lie on a sofa in the coffee-room detached, and read the
&lsquo;Times,&rsquo;&mdash;go into the drawing-room and play the
piano, or sit under the garden trees and gaze on the fair blue
sea, and hope fervently that, with a strong Tory government to
protect our institutions, this hotel may be long kept hid from
that merciless monster the &ldquo;Company (Limited).&rdquo;&nbsp;
But already a railway runs here, and threatens its quiet.&nbsp;
Even a steamer now and then from France screws its way into the
very narrow channel, where the river Arun has wound down thus far
from Arundel. <a name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188"

<p>The boy and his dog formed a small crowd on the little pier to
see the Rob Roy start again with a fine breeze off shore, but
freshening every minute until near Selsea Bill it blew half a
gale.&nbsp; The navigation round this point is difficult at low
water, as may be seen from the markings in the chart copied at
page 245, merely as a specimen of what a chart is for the
sailor&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>At last it was necessary to reef main-sail and jib, the wind
blew so hard and in gusts, and the adverse tide met me as it
rushed out of Spithead with a heavy swell.&nbsp; Rain poured down
slanting with the wind, and the rocks, uncovered at low water,
looked very uninviting to leeward.</p>
<p>The little dingey was towed astern, as we had <!-- page
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>not expected so much sea with a north wind, but for the
first time we found how perfectly this diminutive boat was
adapted for towing, and after this trial she was never again
stowed in the cabin.&nbsp; The bluff bow above, and the keelless,
round, smooth bottom below, enabled the dingey to top the
sharpest wave, and I often forgot my steering while turning round
to watch the little creature as she nimbly leaped over the
tumbling billows.&nbsp; The weather got worse, therefore we
changed for a storm-mizen, and so many seas broke heavily over
the Rob Roy, that the water in the well washed about my ankles,
and finally we were compelled to give in and lie-to for an hour
or more, after manning the pump.</p>
<p>This wind, rain, and sea together were the worst we had met
with, but the yawl seemed in high spirits, like her owner; though
the waves in the tide-way were sometimes so short and sharp that
it was impossible to rise and fall fast enough, and she often
buried deeply.&nbsp; It was here that my chart was so wet that it
melted before my eyes, even with all endeavours to preserve it,
and therefore I bore up for Brading Harbour, in the Isle of
Wight, and somehow managed to get round Bembridge reef all safe
into the quiet lake beyond.</p>
<p>Here, and on British soil again, was an end to <!-- page
191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>all expected anxieties of the summer&rsquo;s
voyage.&nbsp; The rest to come were to be met, but not
anticipated.&nbsp; There had been first the goal of Paris to be
reached at a certain time for the Regatta there, and then there
was the unknown voyage over the Channel, homeward bound; but
henceforth no more dates or wide seas had to be thought of, and
the rest of the vacation was free.</p>
<p>The shores and seas about the Isle of Wight looked more
cheerful and lovely than ever, with a fair day next
morning.&nbsp; Here we soon pass one of the new sea-batteries, a
huge granite castle, reminding one of Bomarsund, but unfinished,
and with scaffolds round that are worked or stopped, as
Ministries go out or in, and as guns or iron plates are proved
strongest in turn at Shoeburyness.</p>
<p>Portsmouth is in front, always with moving life on the
waves.&nbsp; A squadron of ironclads presses heavy on the water
at Spithead, and among them conspicuous is the five-masted
Minotaur.&nbsp; White-winged yachts glide through the blue space
between these and Ryde.&nbsp; Osborne basks in the sunshine with
the &ldquo;sailor Prince&rsquo;s&rdquo; pleasure-boat by the
shore.&nbsp; If there be a gap or two in the horizon it is soon
filled up by some rich laden merchantman, with sails swelling
full in the light, and gay signal flags flowing out bright
colours; and <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>all the scene is woven together, as
it were, by swift steamers flitting to and fro like shuttles
strung with a thread of foam across a warp of blue.</p>
<p>But it is to that wooded point at Cowes we are steering, and
the tall yellow masts clustered there shew already what an
assemblage the yawl will meet at the Royal Yacht Squadron
Regatta.</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of sailor&rsquo;s pride as our yawl
steadily advanced, steering in among these, the smallest of them
all, but ready to be matched against any of its size and
crew.&nbsp; She quietly approached the crowded quay, and I put my
portmanteau ashore at the Gloucester Hotel; then the jib was
filled again to sail up straight to Medina dock, where Mr. John
White would see the craft he had modelled, and after a careful
survey, the verdict upon her was entirely favourable. <a
name="citation192"></a><a href="#footnote192"
class="citation">[192]</a></p>
<p>On her safe arrival at Littlehampton, after crossing the
Channel, a short account of the voyage had been sent to the
&lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and this had reached the numerous yachtsmen
at Cowes an hour before the boat herself appeared in front of the
<!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>Club house.&nbsp; Therefore, the little craft required
no more introduction.&nbsp; My flag was my card, and I was
speedily made a member of the Club for the time being.&nbsp; Many
old friends here greeted me, and many new visitors came on board
to congratulate, while His Royal Highness the Commodore of the
Royal Canoe Club, whose burgee flew at my mast-head, graciously
shook hands.</p>
<p>While the ship carpenters at Medina Dock are making my new
bowsprit, and a hundred other things, and Mr. Ratsey is putting
the last finish to my sails, we may examine a little the upper
gear of the yawl, for that has not yet been specially noticed;
but as ladies and landsmen often come on board, who do not
require a minute description of all the ropes and spars in the
Rob Roy, they can skip the rest of this chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>From the sketches of the yawl given in our pages, it will be
seen at once that she was under-masted and under-sailed.&nbsp;
She could bear a spread of canvas double of that she carried; but
for safety, for handiness, and for comfort, we must be content to
sacrifice some speed.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was only in a very powerful breeze that the
beautiful build and lines of the hull had anything like fair play
for shewing her pace through the water.&nbsp; <i>Then</i>,
indeed, and when other craft were reeling about and shipping
seas, even under reefed canvas, the Rob Roy at once asserted her
position.</p>
<p>We have spoken of the excellent mast already.&nbsp; The
shrouds were of iron rope.&nbsp; This is affected by heat and
wet, but not <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>so much, as cordage is.&nbsp; The
screw links to tighten the shrouds seldom had to be employed; a
copper rope from the truck to a shroud acted as a lightning
conductor.</p>
<p>The bowsprit is on the starboard side, for this allows you to
use the light hand with the chain cable in the bitts.&nbsp; The
jib has a foot of nine feet in stride.&nbsp; Its tack is on a
rope round an open hook at the bowsprit end, so that in reefing
you can get it in without danger of falling overboard while
reaching out to detach it; then it is hooked on the stem.&nbsp;
An iron bobstay we discarded, and an iron forestay, as difficult
to keep taut; but, after trials with no bobstay at all, we found
it advisable to replace this, although it is a troublesome rope
in dealing with the anchor.</p>
<p>The gunwale has an opening of half an inch, all round, and
this was enough for scuppers.</p>
<p>The forehatch is thirteen inches square, so that I can readily
squeeze down into the fore-cabin.</p>
<p>I painted about a foot of the chain-cable of a bright red
colour, at ten and at twenty fathoms, which was useful in telling
how much ran out with the anchor.&nbsp; Fenders I got in Paris,
very neatly made of line net-work, over canvas bags of cork.</p>
<p>The iron sheave on the stem for the anchor-chain was large,
with a high cheek, and the comfort of this was well appreciated
in weighing anchor at night or in a swell.&nbsp; The jib-sheets
led aft, and the position of the cleats for these was most
carefully chosen, as they are more worked than any part of the
rigging; yet this position was twice altered, and the best place
seems to be on the deck, two feet forward from your breast and
two feet to the side.</p>
<p>The strain on these sheets in rough weather was greater than
had been anticipated, and at last I had to put a tackle on the
port jib-sheet, as that is the one less conveniently placed for
belaying.</p>
<p>The peak halyard was fast to the gaff, then through a <!--
page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>single block on the mast and one on the gaff, and again
one aloft.&nbsp; The throat halyard was fast to the mast, and
through a block on the throat, and then aloft.&nbsp; Both these
halyards came down on the starboard side, and to separate cleats,
but I found it generally more ready to haul on the two at once
and belay them together.</p>
<p>The jib-halyard had a block on the sail, and then, with the
topping lift, came down on the port side.&nbsp; A jib purchase I
soon cut away&mdash;one learns to be economical of action when
alone.&nbsp; Each of these four ropes then passed through a
sheave on deck, two on each side, in an iron frame, properly
inclined to give a clear lead. <a name="citation195a"></a><a
href="#footnote195a" class="citation">[195a]</a></p>
<p>Sisterhooks are troublesome things.&nbsp; Some much better
plan as a substitute has to be invented, but I used for their
&ldquo;mousings&rdquo; india-rubber rings, which answered
perfectly well, and were easily replaced at six for a penny.</p>
<p>Stocking and re-stocking the anchor were the only operations
when I felt the want of another hand, either to do the work at
the bow or to give that one touch to the tiller at the critical
moment, which an infant could do when near it, but which is hard
for a man at a distance.&nbsp; The anchors were on deck, one at
each side of the bitts, and fitting securely within the
gunwale.</p>
<p>Two things, above all, I must try to devise for next
voyage,&mdash;a cleat that will need no bends, <a
name="citation195b"></a><a href="#footnote195b"
class="citation">[195b]</a> but hold anywhere <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>instantly,
and an anchor-stock, self-acting in dark, rain, and wind, and
without a forelock to slip out or get jammed.</p>

<p>The hatch of the well was in two parts, and one of them, a
foot in breadth, had chocks on each side, so that in rain and
dashing spray it was fixed up at an angle before me, and thus
only my eyes were above it exposed, and by moving my head down
about one inch below the position shewn in the sketch, I could
see the compass and the chart.&nbsp; A tarpaulin of one-faced
india-rubber over the sloping board <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>and under
the horse, had its loose folds round one of my shoulders to the
weather side, so that even in very rough water not much could get
into the open well.</p>
<p>The main-boom had a ring working between cheeks and carrying a
double block with a single block below.&nbsp; To reduce the long
fall of the sheet I altered the upper block to a single one; but
in the first heavy weather afterwards it was found to be too
small a purchase.&nbsp; The force of the wind is underrated if
you reason about it in fair weather.</p>
<p>The sheet block was fast to a strong, plain, copper ring, as a
traveller, and after much trouble and expense about a horse for
this, trying first an iron one, then a copper rope, and then
hemp, I found that a rounded inch bar of red iron-wood straight
across and about two inches above the bulkhead of the well,
answered to perfection. <a name="citation197"></a><a
href="#footnote197" class="citation">[197]</a></p>
<p>The oars were stowed one on each side of the hatch combing
with blades aft, and looms chock up to the gunwale at the bows,
so as to be seldom moved by a rush of sea along the deck, and yet
one or other or both could be instantly put into the iron
crutches always kept ready shipped, and so placed that I could
row comfortably while in the well and facing the bow.&nbsp; The
boat-hook had its handle-end always near my right hand, and this
saved me many a run forward in awkward times.</p>
<p>The tiller of iron-wood was well wedged into the
rudder-head.&nbsp; Of course any joggling or slackness here is
like a broken front tooth, or a loose steel pen.&nbsp; No plan
that I heard of, or saw, or could devise yet, is entirely
satisfactory <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>for enabling the tiller to be set
fast in a moment, at any angle, and yet to be <i>perfectly</i>
free in ordinary times.&nbsp; I used a large piece of rough cork
as a wedge to set the tiller, and a cord loop at each side of the
gunwale, to keep it &ldquo;hard down&rdquo; when going
about.&nbsp; At night, to stop the vibration of the rudder, I
knocked in a brass wedge between its head and the iron bushing of
the rudder hole.</p>
<p>Every bit of iron above water was galvanized; but this
operation weakens small pieces of iron unless it is carefully
done.&nbsp; However, the only part which carried away was my
small anchor-stock, and this took place at the first cast of it
into the Thames.</p>
<p>Such is the Rob Roy yawl, of 4 tons register, and the map
(about 70 pages farther on) shews the general course of her first
sea voyage by a dotted line, but many a long mile of zigzag had
to be sailed besides.</p>

odd story&mdash;The law of anchors&mdash;Experiments&mdash;The
Royal yacht.</p>
<p>Medina Dock is the place to see all sorts of ships and boats
for steam, sailing, or rowing, lifeboats, rafts, and
models.&nbsp; The basin is full of broken-backed men-of-war whose
old black bones are being disjointed and dragged asunder here to
make strong knees again, just because they are black and well
seasoned.&nbsp; Alongside the quay we had seen the three American
yachts, which came across the Atlantic amid many English cheers
for the vessels of two hundred tons crossing from New York, while
we scarcely record the voyages of our own hundred-ton vessels
that have often sailed to Australia.</p>
<p>In Mr. White&rsquo;s garden there are Chinese junks <!-- page
200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>and catamarans afloat in a pond, and even the walls
around are not allowed to be quite of dry land, being painted
with sea soundings and charts of the neighbouring coasts.&nbsp;
This may indeed be called the Admiralty of the yacht fleet, and
Cowes is its Portsmouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nauta nascitur non fit,&rdquo; which is in English,
&ldquo;British boys are ducklings born to the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now many of these have affectionate parents not web-footed,
and the filial duty of a little duck to the motherly hen is a
very difficult question of conscience when a pond is near; but
then there is no positive need to boat, while there <i>is</i> a
positive command to obey.&nbsp; This ought to solve the question
with all brave loving boys, who are manly enough to obey the
woman dearest on earth to them.</p>
<p>A little vessel two feet long may be called a toy ship, but it
is a toy that can teach much to an Admiral, and I should not like
to have as my comrade on a voyage the man of forty who can pass
the Serpentine without a glance at the little ragged urchin
there, who is half in the water himself while he reaches with a
twig his tiny lugger after its long voyage across the lake among
ducks, and row-boats, and billows two inches high.</p>
<p>Victoria Park, again, has a feast of nauticalities <!-- page
201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>now and then for boys who love boats, when the Model
Yacht Club sails its liliputian squadron for a half-crown
cup.</p>
<p>The competing yachts first lie on the green grass for
inspection.&nbsp; They are made in &ldquo;off hours&rdquo; by
working men, who sail as well as build them.&nbsp; Wife or a
school-girl daughter has sewed the sails, and the paint on the
hull is gorgeous.&nbsp; Crowds of all classes and ages are at the
starting-post, and when the pistol fires the cheers begin.&nbsp;
Each favourite in the fleet has its admirers, who run alongside,
and the Secretary alone has a grave face, as of a man on
important duty.&nbsp; Who can say what sailors&rsquo; seedlings
may be watered in that pond, and to grow up in manhood afterwards
as hearts of oak?</p>
<p>And if a boy is too young, or lazy, or clumsy-fingered to make
a boat for himself, let him go along Fleet Street till he comes
to the spot where he can turn his back upon St. Dunstan&rsquo;s
church.&nbsp; Depend upon it he will cross over to the <i>Model
Dockyard</i> there, and after buttoning his jacket over his
watch-chain, and a good shove down to his pocket-handkerchief, if
he has one, let him wriggle in by elbow and knees till he gets a
good place among the crowd at the window.</p>
<p>Even when it is time to go home he will not have seen half the
naval stores here, or the little <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>sailors&mdash;from Cork&mdash;all waiting to be
engaged; but if he buys the <i>Illustrated Handibook</i> inside
from the civil shopman, to con at home, perhaps at his next visit
he may be admitted up-stairs to a delicious treat, where he can
gloat over the more hidden fleet of the future.</p>
<p>Some, perhaps many, people keep yachts who do not enjoy
sailing.&nbsp; We have sometimes seen a yacht-owner who could not
steer his own dingey.&nbsp; There are others whose chief anxiety
when once on board is for their speedy arrival at the next
port.&nbsp; To have the best yacht of the year is no sign of its
owner being a good sailor.&nbsp; The horse that wins the Derby
would most likely not be first if he carried his owner, and a man
may have a good carriage who cannot himself &ldquo;handle the
ribbons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is no discredit to anybody that he is not able to ride a
race, or steer a schooner, or drive a drag; but it is well to
remember more than we do whose is the skill that wins in each of
these exercises.</p>
<p>At Cowes one perceives very soon that a good deal of
<i>yachtomania</i> is fed upon the good meat and drink afloat,
and balls and promenades ashore, and the pomp and bustle of
getting from one to the other, not to forget the brass buttons
which fasten more vulgar minds to some Clubs.</p>
<p><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>Leaving aside all these in peace, provided they play
with the thing as they have a right to do, and as openly as now,
so that none can mistake them, we have still to admire a splendid
set of fellows, yes, and of women too, who really love the
sea.&nbsp; We know a hardy canoeist who said he would not marry
anybody unless she could &ldquo;pull bow oar,&rdquo; and it
certainly is an addition to the family hearth when the tender
help-meet can &ldquo;mind her luff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the regatta week the tide of a congregation coming out of
the pretty church at Cowes is thoroughly aquatic.&nbsp; Fine
stalwart men with handsome faces, girls with chignons as big as a
topsail bunt, yacht skippers of bronze hue and anxious eye, well
fed sailors with cerulean Jerseys, children with hat ribbons and
neckties labelled with yacht names.&nbsp; There were 150 yachts
on the water here, and the Rob Roy anchored close to the Hotel,
from which the sight was magnificent at night, when each
mast-light was hung, and the whole made a brilliant crescent
reflected in calm sea, while excellent music played softly on
shore, and at each half-hour the bell of every vessel tolled the
time, the Rob Roy adding her note to the jingle by so many thumps
on an iron pot.</p>
<p>Near the yawl was a strange little cutter of five tons, as
remarkable for the number of people on <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>board it as
mine was for having so few.&nbsp; There was the grey-haired
hearty papa, and when we had noticed him taking observations with
a sextant, we knew he was &ldquo;a character.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
there was his active son, and a younger brother, and a sister in
bright red, and a sailor boy.&nbsp; They looked even more
numerous, because they kept for ever moving out of sight, and
then appearing in new costume, under and above the awning, which
like a large umbrella, was spread on their boom.</p>
<p>It was a treat to lunch with this kind hale yachtsman, and to
see the one minute cabin full of mirrors, pictures, statuettes,
crockery, and furniture.&nbsp; To make room for the visitor two
of the inhabitants ate their share of a huge pie in the punt
alongside.</p>
<p>Then, to rise at once to the largest yacht of them all, there
was the beautiful &lsquo;Zara,&rsquo; a schooner of 315 tons,
fitted out for a Mediterranean cruise, but making her first
voyage from Cowes to Southampton, convoyed by the Rob Roy, and as
her reefing topsails and her Flemish horse got entangled aloft by
new stiff ropes, she drifted against another fine schooner; but
with cool heads and smart hands on board of each of them, the
pretty craft were softly eased away from a too rough embrace, and
no damage was done.</p>
<p>About twenty of the yachts were steamers, and <!-- page
205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>at
least as many besides had steam-launches, a new adjunct rapidly
becoming popular, and which soon will be almost a necessary for
every yacht of 200 tons.&nbsp; All of these that I saw were
lifeboats, built on &ldquo;Lamb and White&rsquo;s&rdquo;
principle, that is, with air chambers along the sides, so that
they decline to upset, and if they are filled by the sea, they
are not only still floating but steady also.</p>
<p>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution build boats with
ballast below and with air-chambers so disposed at the ends and
in the bottom as to cause the boat to right itself when it has
been overturned, while Mr. S. White&rsquo;s boats are constructed
so as rather to prevent a capsize than to right the boat
afterwards.</p>
<p>During an experimental trial in a heavy sea, one of these
side-chamber boats was intentionally overturned, and it then kept
steadily floating bottom upwards, so that the crew clambered up
safely on the keel, where the handles provided for the purpose
enabled them to hold on.&nbsp; Of the fourteen men, however, only
thirteen could be counted, and so it was found that
&ldquo;Jem&rdquo; was missing; but when he was called, Jem
answered from the <i>inside</i> of the boat, &ldquo;All
right!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&nbsp; Are you
inside?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m looking for my
cap.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was safe enough in the vacant space between
the water and the floor, upturned over him, and <!-- page
206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>there was room for several more of the crew inside.</p>
<p>The two rival systems then seem to represent (1) a boat which
will speedily right, of which the men, if upset, may float
outside until she rights, or may keep inside, and cling to the
thwarts and trust to be soon righted; and (2) a boat which will
upset only under strongest pressure, but the men can either stop
inside, or if cast out can cling to the keel.</p>
<p>To decide between the merits of these lifeboats would require
actual experiment outside and inside of each by the judge, who
ought to look at all sides of the question; but my opinion is, at
present, in favour of the side-chamber plan, for ships&rsquo;
boats, and of course for steam-launches; while the evidence in
favour of the other plan for pure lifeboat service in rough water
is convincing.</p>
<p>Whatever may be finally settled as to the best position of the
air-cases in lifeboats&mdash;and the best men in the world for
these matters are engaged in earnest upon the subject <a
name="citation206"></a><a href="#footnote206"
class="citation">[206]</a>&mdash;it certainly is prudent for all
who care not to be drowned, that the boat <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>they sail
in should be so built as not to go down bodily when a mere hole
is knocked in her, and this may be insured by dividing her into
water-tight compartments.</p>
<p>Some years ago I had a sharp lesson on this point.&nbsp; It
was in Dublin Bay, where I was sailing entirely alone in an iron
cutter-yacht, very small, yet far too large to be managed by me,
then a boy.&nbsp; The throat parrell suddenly broke, and the
mainsail jammed at once, so that she would not stay.&nbsp; Then I
tried to wear ship, but the running sea poured in over the
counter at each plunge, and baling was impossible, for it ran
fore and aft.&nbsp; As the water got deeper inside she settled
down, for she had no compartments, and, being of iron, of course
she must speedily sink.&nbsp; A yacht had humanely come out,
seeing my distress, and she rounded to and dropped a boy on board
me with a strong rope; but when the boy set foot on my bows they
plunged deep under water, and with a loud cry he hauled himself
back on board the other yacht.</p>
<p>The captain instantly tacked and came again, and cast the rope
to me, which I fastened securely to my mast, and then got safely
aboard the preserver&rsquo;s vessel, while mine sunk down, but
suspended still by the rope, until we towed it into shallow
water.</p>
<p><!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>This sort of thing was fully provided against in the
Rob Roy by the water-tight compartments, three in number, besides
the air-chambers, so that if she was filled in any one, she could
yet sail on, and if all three compartments had been entirely full
of water, she would still float with her air-chambers, and with
five hundredweight to spare. <a name="citation208"></a><a
href="#footnote208" class="citation">[208]</a></p>
<p>The buoyancy of the yawl was very remarkable.&nbsp; She easily
carried twenty men, and in the same space one could accommodate
five ladies of reasonable circumference.</p>
<p>A boat&rsquo;s mop is, of course, well known to be always fair
spoil to him who can take it, and whatever other article the
yachtsman leaves loose on an unguarded deck, he never omits to
hide or lock up the mop, for a mop is winged like an umbrella, it
strays, but seldom returns.&nbsp; The usual protection of mops is
their extreme badness, and it is on this account, no doubt, that
you never can find a good mop to buy.&nbsp; The Rob Roy&rsquo;s
mop was the only bad article on board, and I left it out loose in
perfect confidence.&nbsp; Often and often it had evidently been
turned over, but on examination it was found supremely bad, worse
than the thief&rsquo;s own mop, and not worth stealing.&nbsp; At
<!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>last, however, and in Cowes, too, the focus of
yachting, if not of honesty, my mop was stolen.&nbsp; The man who
took it is to be pitied, for, clearly, before he coveted a bad
mop, he must have been long enduring a worse one.</p>
<p>Nor is the property in boats&rsquo; anchors quite free from
the legal subtleties which allow but a dim sort of ownership in
things that are attached to the soil.</p>
<p>When, indeed, your boat is at one end of the cable, you will
scarcely fear that the anchor should be stolen from the other
end.&nbsp; But when necessity or convenience causes you to slip
anchor and sail away, you must recollect that though the anchor
is the emblem of hope, it does not warrant any <i>expectation</i>
that on returning you will find the anchor acknowledged to be
yours.&nbsp; It has now passed into the category of &ldquo;found
anchors,&rdquo; and it is not yet decided how the rights to these
are best determined.&nbsp; However, I may here mention one mode
of settling the matter.</p>
<p>A gentleman we shall call N., sailing from a port on the
Thames, had to slip his anchor, and he said to the lad
ashore&mdash;&ldquo;You see I am leaving my anchor here, and be
good enough to tell your father to get it when the tide falls,
and to carry it to where my yacht is, and when I return here
to-morrow I will give him half-a-crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>After his sailing was over, N. came back and said to
the father, &ldquo;Well, have you got my anchor?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have found an anchor,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, that is mine, and I told your son I would give you
half-a-crown if you brought it here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
found an anchor, and I&rsquo;ll not give it up under five
shillings,&rdquo; said the man; and their argument and
remonstrance gradually enveloped the subject in a hazy
abstruseness, while the usual knot of idlers listened all
round.&nbsp; At length N. said, &ldquo;Come, now, we really must
settle this matter.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll <i>fight you</i> as to
whether I am to pay five shillings or nothing for the
anchor,&rdquo; and he took off his coat and waistcoat, so it was
plain he was in earnest.&nbsp; The other man stripped too, a ring
was formed, and after N., worsted at first, had well thrashed his
opponent, the latter gave up the anchor.&nbsp; Here, perhaps, we
might think the case had ended, but N. had still a point to be
settled, saying to the man, &ldquo;Your bargain was not only to
give up the anchor, but to <i>bring it here</i>;&rdquo; and as
the fellow refused to do this, the valiant N. cut the second
discussion short by saying, &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll fight
you again as to who shall carry it up,&rdquo; and it need
scarcely be said that the anchor was not carried up by N.</p>
<p>Is there any other country but England where two men can
pummel each other in hard earnest, <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>and yet
with less passion at the time, and less grudge afterwards than
often exists for years between two combatants who battle with
their tongues, or even fight with their pens and post-stamps?</p>
<p>As anchors are important parts of one&rsquo;s equipment, I had
begun early to experiment at once with mine, and the small one
had been tried once as a kedge.&nbsp; With the first heave it
broke off short; the stock had snapped in the place which ought
to be the strongest, but which is really made the weakest, by the
present faulty construction of anchor-stocks.&nbsp; The
<i>memo</i> in my log-book was, &ldquo;Invent a proper
anchor;&rdquo; and even at Cowes I could not find any plan that
met this need. <a name="citation211"></a><a href="#footnote211"
class="citation">[211]</a></p>
<p>Before the end of my voyage, a score of minuti&aelig; as well
as things of some importance were marked as lines for great
improvement, when a nautico-mechanical brain shall be brought to
bear upon them.&nbsp; The mental consideration of such points
afforded varied subjects for many weeks&rsquo; thought.&nbsp;
<!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>Indeed <i>all</i> the fittings of a sailing-boat seem
open to much improvement.&nbsp; Meanwhile we have laid down the
large Trotman as moorings in the Medina, while we range about the
bays of the island with the smaller anchor duly repaired.</p>
<p>Of course the dingey had its Sunday voyage at Cowes, and was
everywhere received with kindness.&nbsp; It went to the Royal
Yacht here, as it had done to the Emperor&rsquo;s yacht at St.
Cloud, and the sailors were grateful for books to read, for they
have plenty of time on Sundays.&nbsp; When I went afterwards with
my canoe to the Nile, my next neighbour at the hotel dinner in
Port Said was the owner of an English yacht, who gratefully
expressed his thanks for books given to his crew at Cowes.</p>
<p>It did not appear to be the fashion at Cowes to work the crews
for pleasure sailing seven days a week; indeed, we saw only one
yacht sail in on Sunday, and she was arriving after a
night&rsquo;s voyage.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The life-raft&mdash;A travelled
hen&mdash;Prussian adventure&mdash;American&mdash;Going
up-stairs&mdash;Portsmouth&mdash;Fair
visitor&mdash;Cruises&mdash;A review&mdash;Questions.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Nonpareil&rsquo; American life-raft was in Cowes
after her Atlantic voyage of forty-three days at sea.&nbsp; Two
of her three adventurous crew were Germans, who could speak
English only imperfectly, and the third was a Yankee.&nbsp; This
uncomfortable voyage was undertaken partly to promote the sale in
England of these rafts, and partly to pay the three men by fees
from visitors, while they could see Europe themselves at a cheap
rate.&nbsp; One of Mr. White&rsquo;s steamers towed the raft in
front of the Castle, where the members of the Royal Yacht
Squadron Club have their spacious house, with a sea wall over the
waves.</p>
<p>From the accompanying sketch it will be seen that she is
schooner-rigged, and very coarsely <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>rigged
too.&nbsp; Gigantic flags and streamers overwhelm her masts, but
fourteen of us on her deck seemed to sink the buoyant life-raft
only an inch more in the water.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p214b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>She is made of three long tubes of india-rubber blown up by
bellows; and, when the air is out, these can be packed away
snugly, weighing in all about a ton, and intended to be inflated
and launched from a ship&rsquo;s deck in case of disaster.&nbsp;
A small raft in the capacity of a dingey, but formed like the
other, was towed beside her, and as a special favour I was
piloted to go away in <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>this, which was easily worked by
oars or sculls upon outriggers.</p>
<p>The men had for shelter during their long voyage only a small
waterproof tent on the deck, with a gutter round its edge to
catch the rainwater, and so to replenish their supply, kept in
bags on each side, and now handed about in glasses as
&ldquo;travelled liquor,&rdquo; to wash down biscuits, still
surplus from the &ldquo;sea store.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their cooking
apparatus was at first worked by petroleum, but this speedily
burned the metal out, and they were driven to manufacture a very
ramshackle sort of oil-lamp, fed by the oil for their ship-light
and their compass, and by some supplied from passing vessels.</p>
<p>Two centre-boards, like long narrow doors, placed diagonally
between the web joinings of the tubes, dipped into the water, and
served as a keel, so that when we cast her off from the steamer,
the raft managed to sail a little over to windward.&nbsp; The
whole raft being collapsible when the air is driven out, can be
readily carried aboard ship, and for this it is valuable, but
many other and better rafts compete with this for favour.</p>
<p>The actual <i>substratum</i>, or raft proper, seemed to be
strong and substantial, but the sails and gear were miserably
contrived, and worse executed, in preparation for a long dreary
voyage of six weeks, <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>drifting in wet and weariness, which
I could not but contrast with the pleasant six weeks just passed
in the Rob Roy.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing on the raft was a passenger, who
had come on board her when about a thousand miles away in the
sea.&nbsp; This was an old hen, given to the crew by a passing
vessel.&nbsp; It was a common brown, dowdy, grandmother-looking
hen, and in this prosaic state it was very odd and incongruous,
tethered to the deck by a bit of tarred lanyard, and pecking away
till you looked hard at it, then it cocked up one eye with an air
that said, &ldquo;Why are you staring at <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the visitors to the raft was a wealthy gentleman, who
surveyed the whole with interest, and at last fixed his eye upon
the barn-door fowl, and asked if it was to be sold.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, sir, for a hundred guineas,&rdquo; was the answer;
but he deferred any immediate purchase by saying, &ldquo;If I
thought that eating that hen&rsquo;s eggs would make me as plucky
as you are, I might buy it.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for being
&ldquo;plucky&rdquo; in the matter, what will not men risk for
money?&nbsp; The risks run by many sailors in the rotten coffins
that bring our scuttles of coals round Yarmouth Sands are quite
as great as the hazard on this raft, and their forecastles are
about as comfortable as the tent upon it.&nbsp; If it were not on
such a serious subject as risk to human life, <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>one might
well be amused to hear the wrong estimates of the dangers in
various sorts of voyages which are so hastily expressed by
benevolent people who are ignorant of the whole matter.</p>
<p>I advised the raft-men to take her to Berlin, for exhibition
as &ldquo;the German raft from America,&rdquo; for such she is;
but they persisted in their scheme for showing her in London,
where folks are already tired of &ldquo;flotsam and jetsam&rdquo;
from the West.&nbsp; Their enterprise failed; and the poor
Germans had to depart from England deep in debt instead of laden
with money, and their raft was left for sale.</p>
<p>Since the &lsquo;Nonpareil,&rsquo; there has come to England
from America another floating monstrosity, a boat called the
&lsquo;John T. Ford,&rsquo; worse &ldquo;found&rdquo; in every
sense than the others, and which had three men drowned on the
passage, and one nearly starved&mdash;a sad finale to the
failures of the &lsquo;Henrietta,&rsquo; &lsquo;Red, White, and
Blue,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Nonpariel,&rsquo; as speculations.&nbsp;
Another craft came in with man and wife as crew.&nbsp; Finally in
July, the two Andrews came in the &lsquo;Nautilus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Every day at Cowes the yawl Rob Roy was under way for a sail,
and sometimes in good breezes she would thread in and out among
thickly clustered yachts, so as to show her handiness.&nbsp;
Certainly, without previous practice, it would be highly improper
to attempt this sort of cruising; <!-- page 218--><a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>for the
yachts, with bowsprits run out, and jiggers and mizen-booms
projecting, are at anchor here on the implied understanding that
no one will wantonly endanger a collision by sailing about in the
crowd, merely for fun.&nbsp; After practice, however, for weeks
in the same craft, the operation of guiding her safely through a
maze of boats, and on a strong cross-tide, becomes like the
unnoticed and nearly involuntary muscular efforts of the body
which carry us safely through a crowd on shore.&nbsp; I recollect
once seeing some very dignified Arab Chiefs, who for the first
time in their lives had to go up-stairs, and their awkward
stumbling, even in the ascent of a few steps, showed how much our
nerves and limbs have to learn before we can do so ordinary a
thing without even a thought.</p>
<p>One day the Rob Roy sailed to Portsmouth, and into all the
creeks and crannies, and through all the channels and guts she
could find in that complicated waterway, and then anchored near
the &lsquo;Duke of Wellington,&rsquo; with the old
&lsquo;Victory&rsquo; close beside.&nbsp; There also was the
&lsquo;Serapis,&rsquo; one of the magnificent troop-ships, of a
size and build found to be the best success of our last naval
efforts.&nbsp; By the quay was the &lsquo;Warrior,&rsquo; the
first sea-going iron-clad, and of beauty indisputable, and the
celebrated &lsquo;Wyvern,&rsquo; with its <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>tripod
masts.&nbsp; Others later made, and always more and more stumpy
and square, need a strong pressure of utilitarian conviction to
restrain us from pronouncing that they are downright ugly.&nbsp;
But we shall soon become reconciled, and then enamoured, of forms
that are associated with proved utility, and the grand
three-decker of our youth will look as clumsy then as the ships
of Queen Elizabeth do now, which seem to have carried, each of
them, a lot of toy guns, and a country mansion on its deck.</p>
<p>The church service on board old &lsquo;Victory&rsquo; was most
interesting to take part in when Sunday came round, and next day
her captain came to visit us in his well-manned gig, which,
indeed, was longer than our boat, and he said that the Rob Roy
&ldquo;fulfilled a dream of his youth.&rdquo;&nbsp; This from a
&ldquo;swell of the ocean&rdquo; was a high compliment to our
little yawl.</p>
<p>A boat full of boys, from the Portsmouth Ragged School, sang
hymns on the water in the lovely evening.</p>
<p>Among the other remarkable visitors to the yawl was a pleasant
young lady, who sat in a very pretty boat, rowed by a trusty
man.&nbsp; She had hovered round and round the Rob Roy with a
cautious propriety, which, however, could not conceal a certain
wistful gaze as the narrowing <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>spiral of
her course brought her nearer at each turn.&nbsp; My little
dingey was the attraction, and the lady confessed boldly that she
&ldquo;would <i>so</i> like to have a boat like that to row
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next she consented to see dinner cooked on the
Rob Roy, and&mdash;just because she was a lady&mdash;she complied
with the request not to fly away when I began to eat.&nbsp;
Finally, as curiosity increases by gratifying it, the
good-humoured girl (with the full consent of the trusty guardian)
accepted one mouthful of the newly cooked rations, stewed steak,
on Rob Roy&rsquo;s fork, and then suddenly it had become
&ldquo;very late, and time to join papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The variety of life during a fortnight here, yet all afloat,
was abounding.&nbsp; One day sailing in company with other small
boats up the winding Medina, or tacking about, close-reefed, in
rough water; the next day cruising in some splendid schooner away
and away towards the Needles.&nbsp; Every one was kind and
hospitable, and often dipping their ensigns to the yawl.&nbsp;
Surely we have named her cruise wrongly as &ldquo;the voyage
alone;&rdquo; and, indeed, I could scarcely get time in my cabin
for a glance at a paper, to see the news and doings of the land
folk, bricked up ashore: their wars and congresses and the
general rasping they get for it all by a hard squeeze in the
press at the end of every week, to keep them from <!-- page
221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>forgetting their own discomforts or their
neighbours&rsquo; ills, for Parliament being dispersed in
vacation, there is the fourth estate to legislate by public
acclaim.</p>
<p>Most remarkable it is, and commendable, and a feature only a
few years old, that the principal morning and evening papers
should take up one after another of philanthropic institutions,
and even of individual cases, and advocate them vigorously, while
they spare no wrong from censure, and freely discuss remedies,
which are much harder to talk of than any wrongs.&nbsp;
Philanthropy is made popular by the press, and many a good worker
is cheered by this powerful help.&nbsp; Blessings on their
type!</p>
<p>But on the other hand, lest we should subside into doing good,
hoping better, and making the best of things in a practical way,
the whole has to be reviewed at the end of each week by a hard
hebdomadal board, on which a dozen clear thinkers sit aside and
criticise all the rest of us.&nbsp; Perhaps it is a part of the
irreverence of our times that one should gradually lose awe in
the presence of this weekly printed wisdom.&nbsp; Or is it that
experience finds types are just as fallible as tongues for
telling truth, and that years give us hardiness even in the
presence of that most mighty, wise, and impudent of all <!-- page
222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>earthworms,&mdash;man, that judges the very God of
Heaven.</p>
<p>However, the brilliancy of these critics flares out and
attracts, and it ought to attract, though it need not dazzle,
even if it be the brilliancy of the electric light, warming as
little, and darkening one side as much.&nbsp; Their thoughts
reach thousands, and without the answers: thus to thousands they
are judgments, not arguments.&nbsp; It is a tremendous
responsibility to wield such powers, and perhaps it is not felt
by a corporate body as each one of them would acknowledge for
himself.</p>
<p>It is a good sign of them, or of the age, that they should
yield to man&rsquo;s innate love of continuous detraction?</p>
<p>Is not their own shibboleth the hardest of all, the most
shifting, the most inaudibly pronounced by themselves, if it be
not a universal &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and yet the most rigorously
insisted upon?&nbsp; Is there not a &ldquo;cant&rdquo; of the
vague and complacent denial, quite as bad as that of the too
positive and assumed belief?&nbsp; Will it cure the weakness of
the milk-and-water they complain of to pour in mustard and
vinegar? and would not any one man, with all these bristling
points of sarcasm, dispraise, and bitterness, be about as
pleasant in social life as a porcupine?&nbsp; Surely this
powerful <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>literary lever could be plied to
raise heavier stones, and to settle them in goodly order.&nbsp;
Let others grub in the rubbish; but the leading organ of the week
could sound with a grander harmony, more pleasant, and not less
piquant if it gave rhythm to the mind of England in a forward
march against misery.</p>
<p>Perhaps to write thus is too daring; for while Saturn
masticates his own offspring it is a bold child that complains to
his face; but it is better to be called rash than to be proved
timid.</p>
<p>Meantime we are nearing Cowes in our sail from Portsmouth, and
must mind the rocks and beacons rather than soliloquies, for this
one question may be put after all:&mdash;Is it right to moralize
at all in a log-book? and will not the reader say, that when
there is not a storm in the yawl, or a swamp, there is sure to
come a sermon?</p>

<p>The regatta days opened with wind and rain; but even at the
best of times, the sight of a sailing match from on shore is like
that of a stag hunt from on foot,&mdash;very pretty at the start,
and then very little more to see.&nbsp; It is different if you
sail about among the competing yachts.&nbsp; Then you feel the
same tide and wind, and see the same marks and buoys, and dread
the same shoals and rocks as they do, and at every turn of every
vessel you have something to learn.</p>
<p>No one can satisfactorily distribute the verdict
&ldquo;victor&rdquo; or &ldquo;vanquished&rdquo; in a
sailing-match between the designer, the builder, the rigger, <!--
page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>and the course, the weather, the rules, the sailor of
each craft, and chance; though each of these will conduce in part
to the success or failure in every match.&nbsp; Still there is
this advantage, that the loser can always blame, and the winner
can always praise, which of these elements he finds most
convenient.&nbsp; But if a sailing-match has little in it quite
intelligible, even when you see it, the account of a past regatta
is well worth keeping out of print&mdash;so be it then with this
one, the best held at Cowes for many years.</p>
<p>The large crowds that attended, and their obstinate standing
in heavy rain, were in marked contrast to the phlegmatic and
meagre interest of the few French who came to the regatta at St.
Cloud.&nbsp; But it is such occasions that remind us of England
being a land of seamen, while continental sailors are at best of
the land, except in northern nations.</p>
<p>Once it was my lot to sail in a small screw-steamer along the
coast of Calabria.&nbsp; Of the four passengers one was a
Neapolitan officer, who embarked in full uniform; and with light
tight boots and spurs, and clanging sword, he stalked the
quarter-deck, that is, he took three steps, and was at the end,
and three steps back.</p>
<p>In going out of Messina I saw we should have a tough bit of
sea outside, and was soon prepared <!-- page 226--><a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>accordingly.&nbsp; He did not so, and the first
bursting wave wet him through in a moment, and down he went
below.&nbsp; Some hours afterwards I descended too, and a
melancholy sight was there, with very lugubrious sounds.</p>
<p>In the cabin was a huge tub full of water, and the officer
(spurs, boots, and all) was sitting in it with his legs out of
one end and his head groaning and bellowing from the other.&nbsp;
This was his specific for sea-sickness, and for three days he
behaved about as well as a fractious child who sadly wants a good
whipping.&nbsp; It is no discredit to a man to be sea-sick.&nbsp;
Nelson, we are told, was so far human.&nbsp; But it is somewhat
unmanly for an officer to whine and blubber like a baby, and yet
we have several times seen this phenomenon abroad.&nbsp; When we
came into Naples this lachrymose hero was again in full feather,
boots, spurs, and sword, stalking the quarter-deck as if no tub
and tears had intervened.</p>
<p>Some excellent rowing-matches, after the Regatta in Cowes,
were varied by a &ldquo;punt chase,&rdquo;&mdash;an amusement
thoroughly English; when one man in a punt is chased by four in a
low-boat, who have to catch both him and his boat within ten
minutes.</p>
<p>Of course his path is devious and tortuous on the water, his
resort being quick turns, while the <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>chasers
gain in speed.&nbsp; After numerous close escapes he leaps into
the water.&nbsp; Then if the pursuers catch and hold his boat it
clogs them in following him, and if they follow him while his
boat is left free, he manages to escape round some tangled mass
of shipping, and so regains his boat for a new start.</p>
<p>This is the sort of thing that tries both swimming and pluck
in the water, as well as mere muscle or wind in rowing.&nbsp; It
is to racing proper what a hunt is to a flat race.&nbsp; Rowing
is only one small part of boating, and it is apt to monopolise
our favour chiefly because many can row for one that can
<i>boat</i>.</p>
<p>In one of these punt chases at Cowes the punter had several
times plunged into the sea, and amid shouts and cheers he was
always closely followed by one of his chasers who swam almost
equally well.</p>
<p>At length the brave punter swam over to the
&lsquo;Alberta,&rsquo; one of the Queen&rsquo;s steam-yachts,
which had several of the royal Princesses and others on board,
who kindly thus patronized the races, and their presence was
thoroughly appreciated by us all.&nbsp; The hardy sailor scaled
the yacht, and actually ran among the ladies,&mdash;who doubtless
were much amused, and indeed they tittered vastly.&nbsp; Then he
mounted the lofty paddle-box, <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>closely
followed by his resolute pursuer, who would not be shaken
off.&nbsp; With one moment of hesitation the punter took a
splendid &ldquo;header&rdquo; into the sea, and as he was thus
descending from the paddle-box the gun filed, showing that the
ten minutes had expired.&nbsp; The pursuer could then, of course,
have given up the chase as done.&nbsp; He had lost and could not
win now.&nbsp; But there was still in him that fine free boldness
which superadds brave deed to stern duty, and, amid a burst of
cheers, he too leaped down into the sea.</p>

<p><!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>The first diver, however, had heard the wished-for gun
as he fell and so he claimed his prize when he came up, all red
and watery, and both had well gained the applause of the
spectators.</p>
<p>It is not for one who has rowed fifty races with pleasure to
underrate, far less to disparage, mere rowing; but still we
maintain that for the encouragement of pure manliness, and the
varied capacities useful in a sailor&rsquo;s life, one punt chase
is far better than ten of the others.</p>
<p>The rapid introduction of steam-launches into use for our
large English yachts adds quite a new feature to every grand
regatta.&nbsp; Here again, however, the French navy led the way,
and England follows somewhat tardily.&nbsp; The French fleet at
the Cherbourg review, some years ago had a swarm of these fussy
little creatures buzzing about the great anchored
iron-clads.&nbsp; English steam-launches were built to carry each
a gun, and so they are bluff and slow.&nbsp; Our Admiralty
declined to allow a race between these and the French launches in
Paris, else, no doubt, the superior speed of the French boats
would have astonished John Bull.&nbsp; All this has lately
changed, so that launches and torpedo boats in England can steam
twenty miles an hour.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;voyage alone&rdquo; had culminated at Cowes when
the splendid exhibition of fireworks closed <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>the grand
show of British yachting.&nbsp; It was a beautiful sight those
whizzing rockets speeding from wave to sky, and scattering bright
gems above to fall softly from the black heaven; those glares of
red or green that painted all the wide crescent of beauteous
hulls, and dim, tall masts with a glow of ardent colour, and the
&ldquo;bouquets&rdquo; of fantastic form and hue, with noise that
rattled aloft, while thousands of paled faces cheered loud
below.&nbsp; To this day the deck of the Rob Roy (which is now in
Australia) bears marks of the fire-shower falling quietly, gently
down, but still with a red scar burned in black at the last.</p>
<p>Luggage is all on board again, and our tiny &ldquo;Blue
Peter&rdquo; flies at the fore, for the Rob Roy will weigh anchor
now for her homeward voyage.&nbsp; The Ryde Regatta was well
worth seeing, and she stopped there in an uneasy night, but we
need not copy the log of another set of sailing matches.</p>
<p>Thus in a fine evening, when the sun sank ruddy and the breeze
blew soft, we turned again to Brading harbour, and, just perhaps
because we had come safely once before, there was listless
incaution now, as if Bembridge reef could not be cruel on such a
fine evening as this.</p>
<p>Various and doubtless most true directions had been given to
me as to entering this narrow <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>channel:&mdash;&ldquo;Keep the tree in a line with the
monument; that&rsquo;s your mark.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when you come
there and see the monument, there are twenty trees; and which
then is <i>the</i> tree to guide by?&nbsp; Here, therefore, and
in mundane things on land too it is alike, the misapprehension of
a rule was worse than the chance mistake of undirected
mother-wit.&nbsp; A horrid crash brought us suddenly to rest; the
Rob Roy had struck on a rock.&nbsp; Though I was lax at the time,
and lolling and lazy, yet presence of mind remained.&nbsp; Down
came the sails, out leaped the anchor, and shoving, and hauling,
and rowing did their best; but no, she was firmly berthed on one
of the north-west rocks.&nbsp; Presently a malicious wave lifted
her stern round and the rudder soon bumped on another sharp
ledge, until by sounding and patience I at last got her free, and
rowed out through a channel unconscionably narrow, and then ran
the sails up, and the yawl was safe again, sailing smoothly, with
a deep sigh of deliverance.</p>
<p>A sailing-boat had put off from the shore to help, seeing the
catastrophe, but I signalled to her, &ldquo;Thanks&mdash;all
right now,&rdquo; and she went back.</p>
<p>Soon another boat that had rowed out came near, and the man in
her determined to be a <i>salvor</i> whether or no, and leaped on
board the yawl.&nbsp; I made him get off to his boat; I had not
invited <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>him, nor had he asked permission to
board me.&nbsp; He could see it was the other man&rsquo;s job,
and he ought to have obeyed the signal, as the other did.&nbsp;
Grumbling heavily, he at length asked me to tow him in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;why, yes, I will give you a
tow, though you have been very impudent.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
moment he came near he jumped on board again, resolved &ldquo;to
save me,&rdquo; though I might protest ever so hard.&nbsp; Once
more, then, I bundled him into his boat, and this time rather by
deeds than words.&nbsp; He kept up a volley of abuse all the way
to the shore, and there I gave my yawl in charge of the first
man, who had acted right both in coming out and in going back
when signalled.&nbsp; A hospitable Captain R.N. offered me his
moorings (as a good bed for my yawl), and asked me to breakfast
next day, which was accepted, &ldquo;subject to the wind,&rdquo;
especially as the entertainer was of the clan &ldquo;Mac,&rdquo;
like his guest.</p>
<p>Calm night falls on the Rob Roy, in a little inland lake,
profoundly still, more quiet indeed, in respect of current, tide,
or wind, or human being than any night of the voyage.&nbsp; It
was very difficult to turn in below with such a moon above, and
water quite unruffled.&nbsp; So there was a long lean-to on
propped elbows, and reverie reeled off by the yard.</p>
<p>Daybreak grey, with a westerly breeze, at once <!-- page
233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>dissolved the breakfast engagement, and carried the Rob
Roy to sea, with her own kettle briskly boiling; and now we are
fairly started on our voyage to the Thames again.&nbsp; But the
glowing sun also took its morning meal, and greedily ate up the
wind; and so the yachts from Ryde could be seen far off, looking
farther off in a misty curtain, all only drifting with the tide,
while they raced their hardest for a cup.&nbsp; Yet there is
science and skill in drifting well.&nbsp; If the skipper has no
wind to show his prowess in with sails, he must win by his
knowledge of current, tide, and channel, while he seems perhaps
to be carried along helplessly.&nbsp; One after another the
pretty racers slowly rounded the Warner light-ship, and then each
sunk back, as it were, into the gauzy distance, until they seemed
like white pearls dotted on grey satin, and the Rob Roy was alone
again, while the fog thickened more.&nbsp; Land was shut out,
then sky, then every single thing, and the glazed sea seemed to
stiffen as if it had set flat and smooth for ever.</p>
<p>To know that this state of thing was to last for hours would
make it intolerable, but the expectancy of every moment buoys up
the mind in hope, and every past moment is buried as you reach
thus forward to the next coming.</p>
<p>Then the inexorable tide turned dead against me, and down went
my anchor; for, at any rate, <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>we must not
be floated backwards.&nbsp; Tool-chest opened, and hammer and saw
are instantly at work, for there are still &ldquo;things to be
done&rdquo; on board, and when all improvements shall have been
completed then vacant hours like these will be tedious enough;
but never fear, there is no finality in a sailing-boat, if the
brain keeps inventing and the fingers respond.</p>
<p>Out of the thick creamy fog a huge object slowly loomed, with
a grand air of majesty, and a low but strenuous sound as it came
nearer and clearer to eye and ear.&nbsp; It was an enormous
Atlantic Steamer, and it went circling round and round in ample
bends, but never too far to be unexpected again.&nbsp; Sometimes
her great paddles moved with a measured plash, but slow, until
she dissolved before my eyes into a faded vision.&nbsp; Again,
when hidden, there would still come a deep moaning from her
hoarse fog-whistle out of the impenetrable whiteness, and she
again towered up suddenly behind, ever wheeling, gliding on,
vapour and water so commingled that you could not say she
floated, but was somehow faintly present like the dim picture on
a canvas screen from a magic lantern half in focus.&nbsp; She was
searching in the fog for the &lsquo;Nab&rsquo; light-ship, thence
to take new bearings and cleave the mist in a straight course at
half-speed for Southampton.&nbsp; <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>When she
found the &lsquo;Nab&rsquo; she vanished finally, and I was glad
and sorry she was gone.</p>
<p>After long waiting, the faintest zephyr now at last dallied
with my light flag for a minute, and the anchor was instantly
raised.&nbsp; A schooner, also outward bound, soon gently burst
its way through the cloudy barrier, and I tried to follow her,
but she too melted into dimness, and left me in a noiseless,
sightless vacancy, except when the distant gong of the light-ship
told that they also had a fog there.</p>
<p>How did the ancients by any possibility manage to sail in a
fog without a compass?&nbsp; In those days, too, they had no
charts; yes, and there was no &ldquo;Wreck chart,&rdquo; to tell
at the year&rsquo;s end all the havoc strewn at the bottom of the
sea.</p>
<p>Well, we sailed on and on, always seeming to sail on into pure
cotton-wool, which blushed a little with an evening tint as the
sun tired down, and so here was a long day told off and ending;
but where exactly am I now as darkness falls?</p>
<p>You will say, &ldquo;Why, the chart tells that, of
course;&rdquo; and so it does, if you have anything like sure
reckoning to indicate what part of the mazy groups of figures on
it to look for as your probable place; otherwise a dozen
different places in it will all suit your soundings, and eleven
of them are wrong.</p>
<p><!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>Consider the <i>data</i>, for our calculation.&nbsp;
The Rob Roy had been carried by two tides; one this way, the
other that.&nbsp; She had sailed on three different tacks, that
is, in various angular directions, and with different speeds, and
these complicating forces had acted for times very
uncertain.&nbsp; Where is she now? an all-important question for
settling the start point in a night cruise, and on a dangerous
coast.</p>
<p>The last time I was sailing in fog was on the Baltic, in my
canoe, where, just at the nick of time, a look-out man was
descried on a high ladder far overlooking the low rocky islands
of the Swedish coast, and he speedily showed me that my bow was
then pointed exactly wrong for the desired haven.</p>
<p>This may be the time, perhaps, to compare the canoe voyages
with the yawl cruise, even if we cannot settle the question so
often put to me, &ldquo;Which was the most agreeable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A canoe voyage can be enjoyed by several men, each in a
separate boat, and yet all in a combined party; that is, with
distinct responsibility but united companionship.&nbsp; The yawl
cruise devolves both toil and care on one alone, but he also has
all the pleasure, and so it might be pronounced at once to be
more <i>selfish</i> than the other voyage.&nbsp; But after a
score of <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>tours, in large and small parties, I
see that selfishness is quite independent of the number
concerned.&nbsp; A man who is pleasing his wife or his children
in a tour I do not count at all; for everything that delights or
benefits <i>them</i> is of course a pleasure to <i>him</i>.&nbsp;
Or again, he may journey with ten companions, and his travelling
circle will indeed be larger, but the centre of it may be after
all the same.</p>
<p>Of the thousand tourists who rush out over the Continent each
summer there is little check on selfishness by meeting people in
trains, steamers, and hotels for a temporary acquaintance which
is speedily dissolved as soon as the interests or the likings of
the companions are not coincident.</p>
<p>Unselfishness appears to consist in doing good when it is not
exactly pleasant to do it, and to people who are not in our own
groove, or in &ldquo;our set,&rdquo; but like the people invited
in the feast prescribed by Christ, and for whom we work as a
duty, whether it is immediately agreeable or not.&nbsp; It is
giving up our own will to God&rsquo;s command and obeying this
ungrudgingly: and yet our own pleasure may be most in giving
others pleasure, and we can be lavish of labour for others while
we are selfish at the core.&nbsp; Thus it seems to be very
difficult ever to be unselfish in the sense that it is often
absurdly insisted upon; namely, that <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>others are
everything and yourself nothing.&nbsp; Nevertheless, after all
casuistry, we know what is <i>meant</i> by &ldquo;selfish,&rdquo;
as an undue regard.&nbsp; But the result of an action is to be
looked at, and it does not become selfish because we alone do one
part of it.&nbsp; A man who steps out from a crowd to pluck
flowers alone on the edge of the cliff may bring back a bouquet
that will give fragrant pleasure to them all, while another who
stays in the group of gatherers may gather none at all or may be
very selfish about his handful.&nbsp; Our lonely labour may, in
fact, be useful for other people in the end.</p>
<p>The anxieties of the canoe trip are more varied and less heavy
than in a sailing cruise.</p>
<p>In the yawl I was always sure of food and lodging, but then in
the canoe one does not fear wind, wave, calm, and fog; for, at
any rate, one can at the worst take the canoe ashore.&nbsp; The
risk of a total loss of the canoe is only fifteen pounds gone,
but the other shipwreck risks ten times as much, and whereas each
canoe danger can usually be avoided, those met in sailing at sea
are often to be encountered without any escape.</p>
<p>The physical endurance required in a canoe is more under
control of a previous arrangement.&nbsp; The muscular exertion
with the paddle is generally voluntary, while that in the yawl
was often hardest when one wanted most to rest.&nbsp; You need
<!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>scarcely be forced, in canoeing, to go on two days and
two nights without sleep, as will presently be seen was my fate
in the yawl.</p>
<p>The scenery in traversing land and water in a canoe is of
course more varied than in sailing always at sea, but the perils
of the deep have a grandeur and wideness that seem to rouse far
more the inner soul and with more profound emotions.&nbsp; The
thoughts during a night storm at sea are of a higher strain than
those in passing the rapids in a river.</p>
<p>Finally, there is at first a sense of incongruity in the
appearance of a canoe when in a cart, on a train, or in a house,
and you have often to meet an inexplicable but evident
<i>smile</i> at the whole affair, which perhaps comes from pity,
certainly from ignorance, and it may be from contempt; whereas a
sailing-boat crossing the deep is doing what people in ports and
ships know very well about, and if your boat keeps on doing it
successfully they cannot despise the deed because the boat that
does it is small.&nbsp; A man who comes to the &ldquo;meet&rdquo;
on a little pony will not be laughed at if he is always well in
at the death.</p>
<p>Perhaps the voyage alone in a yawl will not be so often
repeated by other people as that in a canoe, but this last manner
of touring became popular at once.</p>

flies&mdash;First running&mdash;Newhaven&mdash;On the
gridiron&mdash;Mr. Smith&mdash;Tumbledown
walls&mdash;Derelict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the yawl now?&rdquo; was the question we had
asked in the fog, and the natural answer was&mdash;that the chart
would tell, of course.&nbsp; So let us look at the small slice of
chart copied on page 245, which is crammed, you see, with figures
of soundings, and names of banks, buoys, and beacons; but the
only thing to be seen on the actual horizon around us, is the
Owers light behind, and about N.W. in its bearing.&nbsp; The tide
will soon turn against our progress towards the east, therefore
we tack towards shore, so as to be within anchorage soundings
should it become needful to stop, for the wind has just changed
rather suspiciously, and we can even hear the <!-- page 242--><a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>sound of
the drums at Portsmouth as they beat the taptoo.&nbsp; A few
bright meteors shoot athwart the heavens above, reminding us that
this is one of their usual epochs&mdash;the 14th of August.</p>
<p>Now we are in ten fathoms by the lead, and we must anchor
here, for the tide has fully turned and the wind has lulled, and
perhaps it will do to sleep for six hours now before going on
again.</p>
<p>The beautiful phosphorescence of the sea on this occasion was
an attractive sight, and I could follow the line of my hemp cable
by the gleam of silver light which enfolded it with a gradually
softened radiance from the surface of the sea, down&mdash;down to
an unseen depth, where, in sooth, it was dark enough. <a
name="citation242"></a><a href="#footnote242"
class="citation">[242]</a></p>
<p>The gentle motion of riding with a chain-cable is quite in
contrast to that when anchored by a rope; for this latter will
jerk and pull, while the heavier chain, laid in a drooping curve,
acts as a constant spring that eases and cushions every rude
blow.</p>
<p>I intended to start again with any freshening <!-- page
243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>breeze, and to get into Littlehampton for the night;
therefore the small anchor and the hemp cable were used so as to
be more ready for instant departure, and well it was thus.</p>
<p>Time sped slowly between looking at my watch to know the tide
change, and dozing as I lay in the cabin&mdash;the dingey being
of course astern; until in the middle of the night, lapsing
through many dreams, I had glided into that delicious state when
you dream that you are dreaming.&nbsp; On a sudden, and without
any seeming cause, I felt perfectly awake, and yet in a sort of
trance, and lying still a time, seeking what could possibly have
awakened me thus.&nbsp; Then there came through the dark a peal
of thunder, long, and loud, and glorious.</p>
<p>How changed the scene to look upon!&nbsp; No light to be seen
from the Owers now, but a flash from above and then darkness, and
soon a grand rolling of the same majestic, deep-toned roar.</p>
<p>Now I must prepare for wind.&nbsp; On with the life-belt,
close the hatches, loose the mainsail, and double reef it, and
reef the jib.&nbsp; Off with the mizen and set the storm-sail,
and now haul up the anchor while yet there is time; and there was
scarcely time before a rattling breeze got up, and waves rose
too, and rain came down as we sailed off south to the open sea
for room.&nbsp; Sea room is <!-- page 244--><a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>the
sailor&rsquo;s want: the land is what he fears more than the
water.</p>
<p>We were soon fast spinning along, and the breeze brushed all
the haze away, but the night was very dark, and the rain made it
hard to see.&nbsp; Now and then the thunder swallowed all other
sounds, as the wild cries in the desert are silenced by the
lion&rsquo;s roar.</p>
<p>Sometimes there was an arch shining above as the flashes
leaped across the upper clouds, and then a sharp upright prong of
forked lightning darted straight down between, while rain was
driven along by the wind, and salt foam dashed up from the
waves.&nbsp; It seemed like an earthly version of that heavenly
vision which was beheld in Patmos by the beloved
John:&mdash;&ldquo;And I heard as it were the voice of a great
multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of
mighty thunderings.&rdquo; <a name="citation244"></a><a
href="#footnote244" class="citation">[244]</a></p>
<p>How well our English word &ldquo;thunder&rdquo; suits the
meaning in its sound, far better than <i>tonnerre</i> or
<i>tonitru</i>!</p>
<p>In the dark, a cutter dashed by me, crossing the yawl&rsquo;s
bows, just as the lightning played on us both.&nbsp; It had no
ship-light up, shameful to say.&nbsp; I shouted out, &ldquo;Going
south?&rdquo; and they answered, &ldquo;Yes; come along off that
shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>From the bit of chart here copied (covering only a few
miles) it will be understood what kind of shore we had to
avoid.&nbsp; There was quite water enough for our shallow craft,
but it was <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>the twisting of currents and tides
that made the danger here.</p>
<p>The breeze now turned west, then south, and every other way,
and it was exceedingly perplexing to know at once what to do in
each case, especially as the waves became short and snappish
under this pressure from different sides, and yet my compass
quietly pointed right, with a soft radiance shining from it, and
my mast-light in a brighter glow gleamed from behind me <a
name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246"
class="citation">[246]</a> on the white crest of the waves.</p>
<p>At one time a heavy squall roughened the dark water, and taxed
all my powers to work the little yawl; but whenever a lull came,
or a chance of getting on my proper course again, I bent round to
&ldquo;East by North,&rdquo; determined to make way in that
direction.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night my compass lamp began to glimmer
faint, and it was soon evident that the flame must go out.&nbsp;
Here was a discomfort: the wind veered so much that its direction
would be utterly fallacious as a guide to steer by, and this
uncertainty might continue until the lightning ceased.&nbsp;
Therefore, at all hazards, we must light up the compass
again.&nbsp; So I took <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>down the
ship-light from the mizen shroud, and held it between my knees
that it might shine on the needle, and it was curious how much
warmth came from this lantern.&nbsp; Then I managed to get a
candle, and cut a piece off, and rigged it up with paper inside
the binnacle.&nbsp; This answered for about ten minutes, but
finding it was again flickering, I opened the tin door, and found
all the candle had melted into bright liquid oil; so this
makeshift was a failure.&nbsp; However, another candle was cut,
and the door being left open to keep it cool, with this lame
light I worked on bravely, but very determined for the rest of my
sailing days to have the oil bottle always accessible.&nbsp;
Finally the wind blew out the candle, though it was very much
sheltered, and the ship-light almost at the same time also went
out suddenly.&nbsp; Then we lay to, backed the jib, opened the
cabin hatch, got out the oil, thoroughly cleaned the lamp, put in
a new wick, and lighted it afresh, and a new candle in the
ship&rsquo;s light; again we started all right once more, with
that self-gratulation at doing all this successfully,&mdash;under
such circumstances of wind, sea, and rain,&mdash;which perhaps
was not more than due.</p>
<p>What with these things, and reefing several times, and cooking
at intervals, there was so much to do and so much to think about
during the <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>night that the hours passed quickly,
and at last some stray streaks of dawn (escaped before their time
perhaps) lighted up a cloud or two above, and then a few
wave-tops below, and soon gave a general grey tint to all around,
until by imperceptible but sure advance of clearness, the vague
horizon seemed to split into land and water, and happily then it
was seen plainly that the Rob Roy had not lost way in the
dark.</p>
<p>As soon as there was light enough to read we began to study
Shoreham in the Pilot book, and neared it the while in the water;
but though now opposite the Brighton coast, it was yet too
faraway to make out any town, for we had stood well out to sea in
the thunderstorm.&nbsp; All tiredness passed off with the fresh
morning air, and the breeze was now so strong that progress was
steady and swift.</p>
<p>It may be remarked how a coast often appears quite different
when you are fifteen or twenty miles out to sea, from what it
does when you stand on the beach, or look from a row-boat close
to the land.&nbsp; So now we were puzzled to find out Brighton,
one&rsquo;s own familiar Brighton, with its dull half-sided
street, neither town nor bathing-town, its beach unwalkable, and
all its sights and glories done in a day.&nbsp; We might well be
ashamed not to recognise at once the contour of the hills, <!--
page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>which we had so often trudged over in column or in
skirmish in the Volunteer Reviews.</p>
<p>The chain-pier was, of course, hardly discernible at a great
distance.&nbsp; But the &ldquo;Grand Hotel&rdquo; at last
asserted itself as a black cubical speck in the binocular field,
and then we made straight for that; Shoreham being gradually
voted a bore, to be passed by, and Newhaven adopted as the new
goal for the day.</p>
<p>We had shaken out all reefs, and now tore along at full speed,
with the spray-drift sparkling in the sun, and a frolicsome
jubilant sea.&nbsp; The delights of going fast when the water is
deep and the wind is strong&mdash;ah! these never can be rightly
described, nor the exulting bound with which your vessel springs
through a buoyant wave, and the thrill of nerve that tells in the
sailor&rsquo;s heart, &ldquo;Well, after all, sailing is a
pleasure supreme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Numerous fishing-vessels now came out, with their black tanned
sails and strong bluff bows and hardy-looking crews, who all
hailed me cheerily when they were near enough, and often came
near to see.&nbsp; Fast the yawl sped along the white chalk
cliffs, and my chart in its glazed frame did excellent service
now, for the wind and sea rose more again; and at length, when we
came near the last headland for Newhaven, we lowered the mainsail
and steadily ran under mizen and jib.&nbsp; Newhaven came in
sight, deeply embayed under the magnificent <!-- page 250--><a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>cliff,
which, at other times I could have gazed on for an hour, admiring
the grand dashing of the waves, but we had to hoist mainsail
again, so as to get in before the tide would set out strongly,
and so increase every minute the sea at the harbour&rsquo;s
mouth.</p>
<p>It was more than exciting to enter here with such waves
running.&nbsp; Rain, too, came on, just as the Rob Roy dashed
into the first three rollers, and they were big and green, and
washed her well from stem right on to stern, but none entered
farther.&nbsp; The bright yellow hue of the waves on one side of
the pier made me half afraid that it was shallow there, and,
hesitating to pass, I signalled to some men near the pier-head as
to which way to go, but they were only visitors.&nbsp; The tide
ran strongly out, dead in my teeth, yet the wind took me
powerfully through it all, and then instantly, even before we had
rounded into quiet water, the inquisitive uncommunicative
spectators roared out, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; and all such stupid things
to say to a man whose whole mind in a time like this has to be on
sail and sea and tiller. <a name="citation250"></a><a
href="#footnote250" class="citation">[250]</a></p>
<p>During this passage from the Isle of Wight I <!-- page
251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>had noticed now and then, when the waves tossed more
than usual, that a dull, heavy, thumping sound was heard aboard
the yawl, and gradually I concluded that her iron keel had been
broken by the rock at Bembridge, and that it was swinging free
below my boat.&nbsp; This idea increased my anxiety to get in
safely; and to make sure of the matter we took the Rob Roy at
once to the &ldquo;gridiron,&rdquo; and laid her alongside a
screw-steamer which had been out during the night, and had run on
a rock in the dark thunderstorm.&nbsp; The &ldquo;baulks&rdquo;
or beams of the gridiron under water were very far apart, and we
had much difficulty in placing the yawl so as to settle down on
two of them, but the crew of the steamer helped me well, and all
the more readily, as I had given them books at Dieppe, a gift
they did not now forget.</p>
<p>Just as the ebbing tide had lowered the yawl fairly on the
baulks, another steamer came in from France, crowded with
passengers, and the waves of her swell lifted my poor little boat
off her position, and rudely fixed her upon only one baulk, from
which it was not possible to move her; therefore, when the tide
descended she was hung up askew in a ludicrous position of
extreme discomfort to her weary bones; but when I went outside to
examine below, there was nothing whatever amiss, and gladness for
this outweighed all other <!-- page 252--><a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>troubles,
and left me quite ready for a good sleep at night.</p>
<p>For this purpose we rowed the yawl into a quiet little river,
and lashed her alongside a neat schooner, whose captain and wife
and children and their little dog &lsquo;Lady&rsquo; were soon
great friends, for they were courteous people, as might be
expected in a respectable vessel; it is generally so.</p>
<p>Now the Rob Roy settled into soft mud for a good rest of three
days, and I went to the Inn where &ldquo;Mr. Smith&rdquo; landed
from France in 1848, after he had given up being King Louis
Philippe.</p>
<p>The Inn traded upon this fact, and it had other
peculiarities&mdash;very bad chops, worse tea, no public room,
and a very deaf waitress! the whole sufficiently uncomfortable to
justify my complaint, and it must be a very bad inn indeed that
is not comfortable enough for <i>me</i>.</p>
<p>Here I was soon accosted by a reader of canoe books, and next
day we inspected the oyster-beds, and a curious corn-mill driven
by tide-water confined in a basin&mdash;one of the few mills
worked by the power of the moon.&nbsp; Also we wandered over the
new sea fortifications, which are built and hewed by our
Government one week, and the week afterwards if there comes a
shower of rain they tumble down again.&nbsp; This is the case, at
any rate, with the Newhaven fortress, and we must <!-- page
253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>only hope that an invading army will not attack the
place during the wrong week.</p>
<p>Three steamers in a day, all crowded with Exhibition
passengers, that was a large traffic for a small port like
Newhaven; but it did not raise the price of anything except ham
sandwiches, and I bought my supplies of eggs and butter and
bread, and walked off with them all, as usual, to the extreme
astonishment of an aristocratic shop-woman.</p>
<p>In crossing a viaduct my straw hat blew off into a deep hole
among mud, and I asked a boy to fetch it.&nbsp; The little fellow
was a true Briton.&nbsp; He put down his bundle, laboriously
built a bridge of stones, and at imminent risk of a regular
mud-bath, at length clasped the hat.&nbsp; His pluck was so
admirable, that he had a shilling as a reward, which, be it
observed, was half the price of the hat itself two months before,
a &ldquo;No. 2&rdquo; hat, useful to shop in.</p>
<p>This incident put an end to quiet repose, for the boy-life of
the town was soon stirred to its lowest depth, and all youngsters
with any spirit of gain trooped down to the yawl, waiting off and
on for the next day also, in hopes of another mishap as a chance
of luck to them.</p>
<p>The dingey too had its usual meed of applause; but one rough
mariner was so vociferous in deriding <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>its
minuteness, that at last I promised him a sovereign if he could
catch me, and he might take any boat in the port.&nbsp; At first
he was all for the match, and began to strip and prepare, but his
ardour cooled, and his abuse also subsided.</p>
<p>Many Colchester boats were here, nearly all of them well
&ldquo;found,&rdquo; and with civil crews, who were exceedingly
grateful for books to read on the Sunday, and, resting among
them, was a little yacht of five tons, which had been sent out
with only one man to take her from Dover to Ryde.&nbsp; Poor
fellow! he had lost his way at night and was unable to keep
awake, until at last two fishermen fell in with the derelict and
brought him in here, hungry and amazed; but I regarded him with a
good deal of interest as rather in my line of life, and I quite
understood his drowsy feelings when staring at the compass in the
black, whistling rain.</p>
<h2><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span

<p>The barometer mounted steadily all Sunday, so we resolved to
start next morning at break of day.&nbsp; But though the night
was quiet the vessels near my berth were also getting ready,
therefore at last I gave up all hopes of sleep, and for
company&rsquo;s sake got ready also after midnight, that we might
have all the tide possible for going round Beachy Head, which,
once passed, we could find easy ports all the way to
London.&nbsp; So about two o&rsquo;clock, in the dark, we are
rowing out again on the ebbing tide, and the water at the
pier-head looks placid now compared with the boiling and dashing
it made there when the yawl passed in before.</p>
<p>Dawn broke an hour afterwards with a dank <!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>and silent
mist skirting up far-away hills, and a gentle east wind faintly
breathing as our tea-cup smoked fragrant on deck.&nbsp; The young
breeze was only playful yet, so we anchored, waiting for it to
rise in earnest or the tide to slacken, as both of them were now
contrary; and meantime we rested some hours preparing for a long
spell of unknown work; but I could not sleep in such a lovely
daybreak, not having that most valuable capacity of being able to
sleep when it is wanted for coming work, and not for labour
past.</p>
<p>The east wind baffled the yawl and a whole fleet of vessels,
all of us trying to do the same thing, namely, to arrive at
Beachy Head before two o&rsquo;clock in the day; for, if this
could be managed, we should there find the tide ebbing eastwards,
and so get twelve hours of current in our favour.</p>
<p>This feature&mdash;the division of the tides there&mdash;makes
Beachy Head a well-marked point in the navigation of the
Channel.&nbsp; The stream from the North Sea meets the other from
the Atlantic here, and here also they begin to separate.&nbsp;
After beating, in downright sailing, one after another of the
schooners and brigs and barques in company, I saw at last with
real regret that not one of us could reach the point in time, and
yet the yawl got there only a few minutes too late; but <!-- page
257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>it
was dead calm, and I even rowed her on to gain the last little
mile.</p>
<p>One after another the vessels gave it up, and each cast
anchor.&nbsp; Coming to a pilot steamer, I hailed: &ldquo;Shall I
be able to do it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; they said;
&ldquo;no,&mdash;very sorry for you, sir; you&rsquo;ve worked
hard, sir, but you&rsquo;re ten minutes too late.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Within that time the tide had turned against us.&nbsp; We had not
crossed the line of division, and so the yawl had to be turned
towards shore to anchor there, and to wait the tide until nine
o&rsquo;clock at night, unless a breeze came sooner.</p>
<p>After three hours&rsquo; work she reached the desired six
fathoms&rsquo; patch of sand, just under the noble white cliff
that rears its head aloft about 600 feet, standing ever as a
giant wall, sheer, upright, out of the sea.</p>
<p>Dinner done and everything set right (for this is best policy
always), I slipped into my cabin and tried to sleep as the sun
went down, but a little land-breeze soon began, and every now and
then my head was raised to see how tide or wind progressed.&nbsp;
Then I must have fallen once into a mild nap, and perhaps a
dream, for sudden and strong a rough hand seemed to shake the
boat, and, on my leaping up, there glanced forth a brilliant
flash of lightning that soon put everybody on the <i>qui
vive</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>Now was heard the clink of distant cables, as I raised
mine also in the dark, with only the bright shine of the
lighthouse like a keen and full-opened eye gazing down from the
cliff overhead.</p>
<p>Compass lighted, ship-lantern fixed, a reef in each sail, and,
with a moment&rsquo;s thought of the very similar events that had
passed only a few nights ago, we steered right south, away, away
to the open sea.</p>
<p>It was black enough all around; but yet the strong wind
expected after thunder had not come, and we edged away eastward,
doubly watchful, however, of the dark, for the crowd of vessels
here was the real danger, and not the sea.</p>
<p>Look at the ghost of Rob Roy flitting on the white sail as the
lamp shines brightly.&nbsp; Down comes the rain, and with it
flash after flash, peal upon peal of roaring thunder, and the
grandeur of the scene is unspeakable.&nbsp; The wind changed
every few minutes, and vessels and boats and steamers whirled
past like visions, often much too near to be welcome.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A white dazzling gleam of forked lightning cleaves the
darkness, and behold! a huge vessel close at hand, but hitherto
unseen, lofty and full-sailed, and for a moment black against the
instant of light, and then utterly lost again.&nbsp; The plashing
of rain hissed in the sea, and a voice <!-- page 259--><a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>would come
out of the unseen&mdash;&ldquo;Port, you lubber!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
ship, or whatever it is, has no lights at all, though on board it
they can see mine.&nbsp; Ah, it&rsquo;s no use peering forward to
discover on which side is the new danger; for when your eye has
gazed for a time at the lighted compass it is powerless for half
a minute to see in the dark space forward; or, again, if you
stare into the blackness to scan the faintest glimmer of a sail
ahead, then for some time after you cannot see the compass when
looking at it dazzled.&nbsp; This <!-- page 260--><a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>difficulty
in sailing alone is the only one we felt to be quite
insuperable.</p>
<p>Again a steam whistle shrieked amid the thunder, and two eyes
glared out of the formless vapour and rain&mdash;the red and the
green lights, the signals that showed where she was steaming
to.&nbsp; There was shouting from her deck as she kept rounding
and backing, no doubt for a man overboard.&nbsp; As we slewed to
starboard to avoid her, another black form loomed close on the
right; and what with wind, rain, thunder, and ships, there was
everything to confuse just when there was every need of cool
decision.</p>
<p>It would be difficult for me to exaggerate the impressive
spectacle that passed along on the dark background of this
night.&nbsp; To shew what others thought, we may quote the
following paragraph from the &lsquo;Pall Mall Gazette&rsquo; of
next day, the 20th of August: <a name="citation260"></a><a
href="#footnote260" class="citation">[260]</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The storm which raged in London through the
whole of last night was beyond question by far the most severe
and protracted which has occurred for many years.&nbsp; It began
at half-past eight o&rsquo;clock, after a day of intense heat,
which increased as the evening advanced, though it never reached
the sultriness which was remarked before the storm of last
week.&nbsp; The first peal of thunder was heard about nine, and
<!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>from that time till after five this morning it never
ceased for more than a few minutes, while the lightning may be
said to have been absolutely continuous.&nbsp; Its vivid
character was something quite unusual in the storms of recent
summers, and the thunder by which it was often instantaneously
followed can only be described as terrific.&nbsp; The storm
reached its greatest violence between two and three
o&rsquo;clock, when a smart gale of wind sprang up, and for about
ten minutes the tempest was really awful.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had noticed some rockets sent up from Eastbourne earlier in
the evening; probably these were fireworks at a <i>f&ecirc;te</i>
there, but the rain must have soon drowned the gala.&nbsp;
Certainly it closed up my view of all other lights but the
lightning, though sometimes a shining line appeared for a moment
in the distance, perhaps from Hastings; and at one time the moon
came out red and full, and exactly at the top of a vessel&rsquo;s
lofty sails.&nbsp; One steamer had puzzled me much by its keeping
nearly still.&nbsp; This drifted close up at last, and they
called out, &ldquo;Ahoy, there!&mdash;are you a fishing
boat?&rdquo;&nbsp; They wanted to know their bearings, as the
current and shifting wind made the position of Beachy Head quite
uncertain in the dark. <a name="citation261"></a><a
href="#footnote261" class="citation">[261]</a>&nbsp; I replied to
their hail&mdash;&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m the yacht Rob Roy, crew of
one man; don&rsquo;t you see my white <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>sails?&rdquo; and they answered&mdash;&ldquo;See? why,
who can see to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes a sudden and dead lull came with an ominous meaning,
and then the loud hissing of rain could be heard advancing to us
in the dark till it poured on the yawl in sheets of water, and
the mere dripping from the peak of my sou&rsquo;wester was enough
to obscure vision.</p>
<p>And yet, after a few hours of the turmoil and excitement, this
state of things became quite as it were <i>natural</i>, so soon
does one get accustomed to any circumstances, however strange at
first.&nbsp; I even cooked hot tea; it was something to do, as
well as to drink, and singing and whistling also beguiled the
dark hours of eager, strained matching.&nbsp; In a lighter
moment, once a great lumbering sloop sailed near, and we hailed
her loudly, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the wind going to
be?&rdquo;&mdash;for the wind kept ever changing (but the thunder
and lightning were going on still).&nbsp; A gruff voice answered,
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say; who <i>can</i> say&mdash;night&mdash;this
sort&mdash;think it&rsquo;ll settle east.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
bad news for me, but it did not come true.&nbsp; The
sloop&rsquo;s skipper wished for an east wind, and so he expected
it.</p>
<p>A stranger sound than any before now forced attention as it
rapidly neared us, and soon the sea was white around with
boiling, babbling little <!-- page 263--><a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>waves&mdash;what could it be?&nbsp; Instantly I sounded
with the lead, but there was no bottom&mdash;we were not driving
on shore&mdash;it was one of the &ldquo;overfalls&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ripples&rdquo; we have mentioned before where a turbid sea
is raised in deep water by some far-down precipice under the
waves.</p>
<p>The important question at once arose as to which of the
&ldquo;overfalls&rdquo; on my chart this could be&mdash;the one
marked as only a mile from Beachy Head, or the other ten miles
further on.&nbsp; Have we been turning and wheeling about all
this dreary night in only a few square miles of sea, or have we
attained the eastern tide, and so are now running fast on our
course?</p>
<p>The incessant and irksome pitching and rolling which the
overfalls caused, might be patiently borne, if only we could be
assured that the yawl progressed.&nbsp; But all was still left in
doubt.</p>
<p>So sped the storm for eight long hours, with splendours for
the eye, and dark long thrills of the sublime, that stirred deep
the whole inner being with feelings vivid and strong, and loosed
the most secret folds of consciousness with thoughts I had never
felt before, and perhaps shall never know again.&nbsp; The mind
conjured up the most telling scenes it had known of
&ldquo;alone&rdquo; and of &ldquo;thunder,&rdquo; to compare with
this where both were now combined.</p>
<p><!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>To stand on the top of Mont Blanc, that round white
icicle highest in Europe, and all alone to gaze on a hundred
peaks around&mdash;that was indeed impressive.</p>
<p>More so was it to kneel alone at the edge of Etna, and to fill
the mind from the smoking water with thoughts and fancies teeming
out of the hot, black, and wide abyss.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Thunder and lightning, also, in the crater of Vesuvius we had
wondered at before; and it had been grander still, when the
flashes lighted up Niagara pouring out its foam that glistened
for a moment dazzling white and then vanished, while the
thundering heavens sounded louder than the heavy torrent tumbling
into the dark.&nbsp; But here, in my yawl on the sea, was more
splendid than these.&nbsp; Imagination painted its own free
picture on a black and boundless background of mind strung tight
by near danger; and from out this spoke the deep loud diapason,
while the quick flashing at intervals gave point to all.&nbsp;
Then that glorious anthem came to my memory, where these words of
the 18th Psalm are nobly rendered:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He bowed the heavens and came down, and
darkness was under His feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rode upon a cherub and did fly; yea, He did fly upon
the wings of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made darkness His secret place; the pavilion round
about Him was dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p><!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>&ldquo;The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the
Highest gave His voice: hailstones and coals of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the channels of waters were seen, and the
foundations of the world were discovered: at Thy rebuke, O Lord,
at the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sent down from above, He took me, He drew me up out
of many waters.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sensations were prolonged enough to be analyzed and
reasoned upon, and it was a difficult question which cannot yet
be answered&mdash;&ldquo;Would I willingly have all this over
again?&rdquo;&nbsp; Lying on a sofa in a comfortable room, I
would not go out to this scene; but in a boat, if all this began
again, I certainly would not go ashore to avoid its discomforts
and lose its grandeurs.</p>
<p>The profound uncertainty as to what was to come next moment
being one of the most exciting features of the occasion; perhaps
the whole scene would be tamed sadly by a mere repetition; but
one sentiment was dominant over all at the time, that I had lived
a long year in a night.</p>
<p>Soon after four o&rsquo;clock, there suddenly stretched out
what seemed to be a reef of breakers for miles under the sullen
rain-clouds, and, with instant attention, the yawl was put about
to avoid them.</p>
<p>This extraordinary optical illusion was the dawn opening on
the coast, then actually ten miles away, and in a very few
minutes, as the cloud lifted, the land seemed to rush off to its
proper <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>distance, until at last the curtain
split in two, and I found to my intense delight that in the night
we had crossed the bay!</p>
<p>Now came joyous sounds from our moist crew&mdash;&ldquo;Hurrah
for the day!&nbsp; Pipe all hands to breakfast&mdash;slack out
the mainsheet, here&rsquo;s the west wind;&rdquo; and up rose the
sun, well washed by the torrents of rain.</p>
<p>An elaborate <i>friture</i> of my last three eggs was soon
cooked to perfection, and I held the frying-pan over the side,
while it drained through a fork; when, alas! there came a heavy
lurch of the boat, and all the well-deserved breakfast was
pitched into the sea, with a mild but deep-meant &ldquo;Oh, how
provoking!&rdquo; from the hapless, hungry, lonely sailor.&nbsp;
Shame that, preserved through such dangers, we should murmur at
an omelet the less!&nbsp; But this tyrant stomach exacts more,
and thanks less, than all the body besides.</p>
<p>Hastings was soon passed, and we skirted the cliffs towards
Rye.&nbsp; I had written to the harbourmaster <a
name="citation267"></a><a href="#footnote267"
class="citation">[267]</a> here to send out a boat if he saw my
craft (enclosing him a sketch of it), as the entrance to that
harbour seemed to be very difficult by the chart.</p>
<p>But the breeze was fresh and invigorating, and though sadly
needing sleep after two nights without <!-- page 268--><a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>any, the
idea of going to bed while such a fine breeze blew seemed
preposterous, and Rye was soon left in the rear.</p>
<p>From this place a very low flat tongue of land stretches along
in the strangest way, until at its end is the lighthouse of
Dungeness.&nbsp; Martello towers are on the shore, but for miles
outside of this, the nearest beach is all one can see; and
therefore the tall lighthouse, viewed even through the glass,
looked only like a small grey speck on the waves, without any
land whatever between.&nbsp; About midday the yawl neared this
very remarkable beacon, which is painted red and white; strong,
lofty, and firm set on a cape of pure gravel, with here and there
a house, not visible at all until you come close.</p>
<p>A heavy sea was here, and it was more and more as we came
quite near the cape; until one fine bold wave, following our
little craft, actually cast the dingey (then towing astern) right
upon the deck of the yawl, and dealt me a severe stroke on the
back, by which I was cast forward, and then an awkward thump on
the head by which I was stunned. <a name="citation268"></a><a
href="#footnote268" class="citation">[268]</a>&nbsp; Recovering
again just in <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>time, I saw another wave send the
dingey once more on board with a crash, and splinters flew up, so
we thought she was smashed, but it was the jigger-boom that was
broken by the collision.&nbsp; The very next billow broke the
dingey&rsquo;s painter of strong canoe rope, but much worn.&nbsp;
Away floated the tiny cockleshell, and it was very soon hid in
the trough of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with the helm!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Haul the
sheet!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Slack the jib!&rdquo; and we gave
chase in great glee, and catching her soon with the boat-hook, we
quickly pulled the dingey on board, and lashed her securely down
to the deck, an arrangement that answered well.</p>
<p>One of the great delights of real sailing is the large variety
of incident that comes.&nbsp; Mere sitting in a yacht, while
others have all the work in a breeze, and all the responsibility,
is no pleasure to me; nay, I confess frankly, it is a
&ldquo;bore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once round Dungeness, we could see Folkestone and Dover
cliffs; and after a few minutes of rest, to put all in readiness
for a fast run before the wind, we steered straight for Dover
pier.</p>
<p>The breeze freshened so much that the mizen had to be lowered,
and as the wind was now favourable, the only thing to beware of
was falling asleep; in which case the boom might jibe (swing-over
from one side to the other) with great force, <!-- page 270--><a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>and if it
hit me on the head, then I should certainly have either a very
short nap or a <i>very long one</i>. <a name="citation270"></a><a
href="#footnote270" class="citation">[270]</a></p>
<p>Dover pier was, we must say, welcome to see.&nbsp; Often at
other times we had intentionally lengthened the day&rsquo;s
journey, in arriving near a destination sooner than it was
absolutely necessary to stop the pleasure of sailing, but now we
ran into Dover as fast as the flying wind would speed us.</p>
<p>The friends who greeted the Rob Roy here knew her well from a
long way off, as she danced lightly over the sea; for hence had
we started months ago, and here was, in one sense, the end of my
voyage, as Ulysses said when he came alone from his raft.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span

</blockquote>
<p>I went up to the Lord Warden hotel, meaning to write home,
dine, and go to bed after fifty-three hours without sleep; but
while waiting for the servant to bring hot water, and with my
jacket off, I tumbled on the bed for a moment&mdash;then it was
three o&rsquo;clock, <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>
<p>Soon (as it seemed) awake again, I saw it was still light, and
with bright sun shining; also my watch had run down, the
water-jug was cold, and it was a puzzle to make out how I felt so
wonderfully fresh.</p>
<p>Why, it was <i>next day</i>, and I had soundly slept on the
top of the bed in my soaking wet clothes for seventeen hours!</p>

<p>Perhaps a sleep in wet clothes, such as we have awakened from,
was more likely to do harm than any of the blasts and breezes at
sea; but nothing followed, and indeed during the whole of my six
voyages alone there was neither a headache nor any other ache,
not even a cold, and the floating medicine-chest yawl was never
opened.</p>
<p>Dover had been the port of departure and again of arrival, for
my first canoe voyage, and the memory of that delightful tour was
recalled now by seeing a canoe paddling in the harbour.&nbsp; On
closer scrutiny it was perceived that a young lady was its
crew.&nbsp; Now there are several fair Members <a
name="citation272"></a><a href="#footnote272"
class="citation">[272]</a> of our Royal Canoe Club, and we are
quite <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>prepared to ballot for some more,
but the captain had not yet been fortunate enough to see one of
these canoeistes on the water, so at once the dingey gave
chase.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p273b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>This was the lady&rsquo;s very first essay in a canoe,
nevertheless she succeeded admirably in her effort, for it is far
easier to learn a little of paddling than a little of rowing, as
every neophyte can tell you.</p>
<p>Henceforth I shall always know that a Rob Roy can well be
matched by a <i>Di Vernon</i>, and how much the most gentle
movement afloat can <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>be refined by feminine grace.&nbsp;
A few hints from the older paddler in the dingey were rapidly
taken up by the apt scholar in the canoe, while her friends rowed
beside us in a boat, and at length with that English pluck which
so many English girls possess, she boldly steered into a
steamer&rsquo;s swell, and then to the open sea, where, before a
soft zephyr murmuring its undertone whispers, we hoisted her
parasol for a sail, and the visitors on Dover pier had a novel
treat in the duet between dingey and canoe.</p>
<p>Fairly rested next day, the yawl sailed by Ramsgate Cliffs
until calm and tide made us anchor in a hot baking sun.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Gull Lightship&rsquo; was not far off, so we
sculled to her in the dingey.&nbsp; This was the very first time
I had myself actually seen the Rob Roy on the water with all
sails set, nor dare I conceal the pride that was felt in looking
at her graceful contour, her smart and sensible rig, and her
snowy sails so beautifully set, as the sunbeams lit them up;
viewed from a little distance, the yawl was only like a toy boat
resting on a sheet of glass.</p>
<p>The men of the &lsquo;Gull&rsquo; with its red sides and red
lantern masts, received me with surprise, but with most grateful
thanks for books to read, and then they pressed their visitor to
stop for dinner!</p>
<p>But he could not well feast in comfort while <!-- page
275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>the Rob Roy was left alone and all sails up, and
especially as one of the numerous vessels then drifting past (we
had counted more than forty in sight at one time) seemed to be
borne dangerously near to the little craft.</p>
<p>On this lightship there are seven men, and four more on land
to relieve them regularly. <a name="citation275"></a><a
href="#footnote275" class="citation">[275]</a>&nbsp; In the
course of a lively conversation with their visitor, they said,
&ldquo;How lonely you must be!&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely when the men
exiled to a lightship pronounce the Rob Roy &ldquo;lonely&rdquo;
there must be something in the charge; but my obtuse perception
has not yet enabled me to find it out.</p>
<p>Meantime the tide had turned strongly, and my row back from
the lightship in the hot sun was one of the hardest pulls I ever
had, so that the lesson will not be forgotten &ldquo;stick by
your ship in a tideway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In passing along the fine gravel beach near Walmer, a curious
sound was heard through the quiet haze; it was distant and
continuous, but like the gabble of 10,000 ducks, and, though
staring hard through the binocular glass, one could only make out
a confused jumble of lightish-coloured forms all in a row afar
off.&nbsp; Soon, however, a bugle sounded the
&ldquo;Retire,&rdquo; and then it was <!-- page 276--><a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>plain that
a whole regiment of soldiers was in the water bathing; their
merry shouts and play had resounded along the level sea, and at
the bugle order they all marched ashore in naked array, forming
altogether one of the oddest of martial sights.</p>
<p>The vessels now constantly crossing my course were of all
sizes, and in the quiet air we could hear their various sounds
that seemed to tell in each of a self-contained world, where
every item of life was summarized on board.&nbsp; Men chatting,
women laughing, dogs barking, cocks crowing, and pigs squealing,
a floating farmyard, such is life on the sea.&nbsp; For the Rob
Roy I had tried to get a monkey as a funny friend, if not as a
tractable midshipman, but an end was put to the idea by the
solemn warning of an experienced comrade, who stated, that after
the first two days, a monkey pursues steadily one line of conduct
afloat&mdash;he throws everything into the sea.</p>
<p>Rounding the Foreland in a lovely afternoon, we observed how
the corn-fields had become ripe and yellow, that were only
growing and green when our yawl passed the cape before.&nbsp;
Here is the &ldquo;Long Nose&rdquo; buoy again, and all the
familiar landmarks, and once more Margate, where the people very
warmly welcomed the little Rob Roy, which they had sped on its
way outward bound with a parting cheer.</p>
<p><!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>The next dawn from its grey curtain rising, saw her
sailing from Margate up the Thames, but so light was the baffling
wind, that we could not reach Sheerness that night, and so had to
anchor in five fathoms not far from Cheney Rock, with dense fog
closing round, and the Nore gong ringing, while my bright little
cabin glowed with comfort, and the newspapers were studied in
peace.&nbsp; Thence sailing into Sheerness and up to
Queenborough, we anchored close by the Coastguard hulk, in safe
and quiet waters.&nbsp; Sunday was a delicious rest, and the
dingey took me aboard the hulk, where a number of sailors and
their large families with them, gave a very remarkable appearance
to the vessel &rsquo;tween decks.&nbsp; The children were
delighted to receive books and pictures, and until late in the
dark the infantile menagerie squalled with all its might.</p>
<p>An expedition of river discovery up the Medway seemed to be
worth trying now, for no bonds of time or engagements fettered
that glorious freedom of action which is one of the prize
features of sailing thus.&nbsp; The yawl went bowling along on
this new errand amid huge old hulks, tall-masted frigates, black
warrior-like ironclads, gay yachts, odoriferous fishing-smacks,
and a fleet of steady, brown-sailed, business-like barges.&nbsp;
This is a pleasant and a cheerful river for some days&rsquo;
excursion, <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>with a mild excitement in sailing
over banks and shoals, and yet not striking once, although we had
no chart.</p>
<p>The tide helps much, until the high ground near Chatham adds
rock and sylvan scenes to the flat banks of the winding
estuary.</p>
<p>Now we come on a busy industry of peculiar type, thousands of
convicts working on the new seawall, closely guarded by armed
keepers.&nbsp; These poor criminals are paid or privileged
according to their good behaviour, and it has been found that
their labour thus stimulated is very productive.</p>
<p>Once fairly up among the war-ships at Chatham, the Rob Roy
anchors by the Powder Magazine, and while a waterman rows away
for the usual supplies&mdash;&ldquo;Two eggs, pat of butter, and
the &lsquo;Times&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;we inspect the Royal
Engineers as they are engaged alongside at pontooning, and are
frequently pulled up by the command of a smart
sergeant&mdash;&ldquo;Eyes&mdash;right,&rdquo; for they
<i>will</i> take furtive glances at my dingey gyrating so as they
had never seen boat spin round before.&nbsp; This comment on the
dingey&rsquo;s shape was ventured, too, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for
hall the world like &rsquo;alf a hegg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pushing on again, still up the river, the Rob Roy had to beat
against an east wind all through the densely packed brigs and
barges in the narrow bend at Rochester, where the difficulty of
working <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>her added zest to the journey, and
now and then a resounding crash from some great barge drifting
down against other vessels, told me that not every one of the
craft was as fortunate in navigation as the yawl.&nbsp; Before us
is the Cathedral, but it is far too stiff in its sharp outline to
arrest the eye for a moment.&nbsp; On the other side, the fine
old weatherworn and time-eaten Castle rears its great tower, and
challenges a long and satisfying look, especially as this was the
only ancient ruin we had seen in the tour, and so there had long
been a yearning in the mind for such, just as there is when you
travel in Norway or America, until at last the hunger for old
things becomes ravenous and intolerable.</p>
<p>The yawl&rsquo;s mast will be able to pass under the bridge,
for the tide is low, and beyond it now we are in sunny green
fields, and sailing on smoothly amid quiet villages, rich
pastures, and the exuberant hop-grounds of thoroughly English
Kent.</p>
<p>Three boys bathing from a boat came near, and for a treat we
took them on board, while their hair dripped wet and their teeth
chattered fast after too long a swim, but they had read the name
on my white flag, and they had also read two canoe books, and so
for miles they devoured all that was said and shewn on the yawl;
then thanking much because they were &ldquo;awfully glad,&rdquo;
and <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>they rowed home.&nbsp; How pleasant
it is to give pleasure to boys!</p>
<p>The Rob Roy got aground only once in this trip above the
bridge, and that only for five minutes, which, except the bump on
a rock at Bembridge, was her sole mishap of this sort, an
immunity quite extraordinary from the seaman&rsquo;s dreaded foe,
the shore.&nbsp; The barges that were now floating up the crowded
Medway interested me exceedingly, and acquaintance was readily
made with their inhabitants almost every day for the next three
weeks, until it became evident that &ldquo;Barge Life&rdquo; is a
stratum of society quite as full of character and incident as any
other, and wide open for examination by those who would study a
<i>genus</i> of mankind very little known.&nbsp; Large and
important duties are entrusted to these men; rich cargoes are
committed to their honesty and skill; families live on barges by
thousands, <a name="citation280"></a><a href="#footnote280"
class="citation">[280]</a> and the coasting journey of a barge is
by no means an easy thing or a dull one.</p>
<p>We must not judge of them by those great black boxes full of
coals, that float on the water <!-- page 281--><a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>above
London Bridge, with one man and a long oar, and yet even a coal
barge is worth watching.&nbsp; In the dank mist of a dull
November evening it will drift unseen past the Temple
Gardens.&nbsp; Wonderful sounds launch into the fog from an
invisible shouter on board, whose &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Bill&rdquo; on a wharf ashore instantly knows the call,
and answers.&nbsp; Then there is a colloquy loud, and public in
the extreme, yet utterly private in its meaning to any one
besides the two who are talking.&nbsp; It is only paralleled by
the shrill interjections of London street boys calling to each
other across the Strand, of which the grown-up public cannot make
out one syllable, but which the stratum below them, of three feet
high, is perfectly contented with, discerning every word.</p>
<p>The barges that trade to the Medway are fine, strong
sea-boats; their sailing qualities are excellent, and they are
improved every year by a regatta specially for them, where forty
gay-dressed, bluff and burly craft compete for prizes.&nbsp; In
this match the utmost of skill, sharpened by years of river
sailing, is shewn in the wind and tide, and knowledge of
intricate channels, and among such competitors &ldquo;fouling is
fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the yawl glides on the water among hayricks and whetting
scythes, one of these gallant barges floated beside us with the
name on its stern&mdash;<!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>S.E.C.P.T.E.R.&mdash;dubious in import, we allow,
whether it means that the stout matter-of-fact lighter has been
christened as a shadowy ghost, or a royal symbol.&nbsp; The
veriest urchin steers her, with a little fat hand on the heavy
tiller twelve feet long, and a hunch of good rye-bread in his
other fist.&nbsp; Now and then he sings out in a thin soprano,
&ldquo;Fayther, boat&rsquo;s a&rsquo;ead,&rdquo; and his father,
(hidden below), answers deep-toned, from the cabin, &ldquo;Keep
&rsquo;er away, lad.&rdquo;&nbsp; From him I asked, &ldquo;How
old is your boy?&rdquo; and the parent&rsquo;s head popped up to
see, but it was the child that smartly answered, &ldquo;Eight
years old.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked five.&nbsp; Round the next
reach the barge bears down, and shakes her sails in the wind to
arrest progress a little.&nbsp; They have come near home, but not
to stop.&nbsp; It is only their country house, and up steps the
bargee mother from out her small <i>boudoir</i> in the cabin
below, and jumping heavily into a boat, she pulls ashore to where
a little girl is meekly waiting ready for orders&mdash;&ldquo;Get
the fish directly, Hagnes,&rdquo; and the daughter runs off
fleetly and back soon, and the mother is speedily aboard
again&mdash;all this marketing being done while the barge has
been drifting slowly past, and then her sails are filled to
continue the voyage.</p>
<p>Night fell, and the yawl anchored by a soft green field, with
the bowsprit among the rushes.&nbsp; Bright <!-- page 283--><a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>furnaces
for lime and plaster works show here and there around, and they
roared and blazed up fitfully with waving jets of flame, like the
iron works in Shropshire, while the reflections glittered on the
river, and reddened long reaches in a glow.&nbsp; The barges kept
streaming by in the dark laden with rich commerce, and merry,
singing crews&mdash;a very curious scene.&nbsp; To them the Rob
Roy, of course, looked quite as strange, and one hailed us
gruffly&mdash;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you?&rdquo; answer,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Rob Roy!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What in the
world did you come here for?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To look at the
beautiful lights on your river.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a murmuring
grumble, he said to that, &ldquo;Too many on &rsquo;em there
is&mdash;we can&rsquo;t see where we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; with
them;&rdquo; and this is indeed perfectly true, for the light of
these furnaces dazzles by its brightness, which is not diffused,
whereas if no lights were there at all, the men could see well
enough, for it is marvellous how the eye will perceive at least
the bounds between land and water, when practice sharpens keen
vision and no false light is shining.&nbsp; It is, however, quite
true also, that the language of the barge-world is not to be
found complete in Johnson&rsquo;s dictionary.&nbsp; It is far
more powerful than elegant.&nbsp; Words that are unused ashore
except in anger or the coarsest abuse seem to be the gentle
appellations of endearment between father and son afloat.&nbsp;
But <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>we must not forget that it is the
meaning attached to a word by speaker and hearer, and not that
given to it by a world outside of both, which the word will
represent. <a name="citation284"></a><a href="#footnote284"
class="citation">[284]</a></p>
<p>From the highest point we could reach towards Maidstone, we
soon ran down again to Rochester, and various were the
conflicting verdicts of bargees as to whether or not my mast
would now go under the bridge, for the tide was very high, and I
sailed back and forward, getting opinions, and surveying the
bridge on all sides.&nbsp; At length I determined it could be
done, and my heart beat nervously as the yawl neared the centre
arch&mdash;not as to danger, but the dishonour of breaking a
goodly spar at the end of a cruise, and in so trumpery a
feat.&nbsp; It passed clear, however, by inches.</p>
<p>The evening was too fine at Sheerness to think of anchoring,
so with a sudden resolve we set off again to Southend.&nbsp; Here
the advice of a yacht lying near was followed foolishly (get
<i>facts</i> from experts and decide on deeds yourself), <!--
page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>for I anchored without sounding, and too late found it
was in shallow water, only eight feet by the lead, and the tide
running out.&nbsp; To bed but not to sleep, for the water sunk to
five feet, and, angry with myself, I roused at one o&rsquo;clock,
gave out all the rope, sheered off shore by the rudder, and then,
again at rest, gained only six inches of depth; but once more
sounding, there was only six inches to spare under the keel and
with a strong breeze on shore.&nbsp; Therefore, now again on the
move, we fastened the inner end of the cable to the larger anchor
and heaved this out, and then payed out all the chain, and
sheered with the rudder, but still she was in shoal water.&nbsp;
Finally, as the wind increased, I had to haul in both anchors and
shove out into the deep, and thus, by omitting to do right at
once what was easy at the time, the whole night had been consumed
by intervals of wet and needless trouble.</p>
<p>Life in the yawl had now become such a pleasant life, that to
leave it was a duty deferred as long as possible.&nbsp; We ranged
several times up and down the Thames, visiting many an old nook,
well known in former days; Holy Haven for instance; it is now
thirty-three years since we first harboured there in a little
sailing-boat and spent a night with a collier captain, and
learned more of coals and <!-- page 286--><a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>colliers
than one could read in a week.&nbsp; This was done by keeping him
resolutely on the point the man knew all about until he was quite
pumped dry.&nbsp; This nice little refuge-harbour is the one I
like best in all the river, with only one house&mdash;no bother
from shore folks, deep channel, and clean sand to anchor
in.&nbsp; If it were not for this narrow and safe retreat, there
would often be hard times in stormy days between Gravesend and
Sheerness.</p>
<p>The first time the Rob Roy went into Holy Haven, we found a
yacht there with a lady and gentleman on board, who of course
(invariable and excellent custom) were hospitable when they read
my flag.&nbsp; Tiny ripples were the only sounds of the evening,
and on looking out on a new day, the round smooth sand was bare
beside me, with a lonely gull preening its soft white wing, and
its calm eye unfrightened, for no one could have the heart to
harm the pretty creature there.&nbsp; The next time of a visit to
this peaceful haven, there was another little craft at anchor,
and in five minutes after we stopped the owner of it sent his
card, with the customary invitation, to come on board.&nbsp; He
was a sailor solicitor who lives on the water in summer (being
wise), but does not venture out of the Thames (being prudent),
and he has a boy &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; who hands out cooked things
<!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>from an inscrutable forecastle, where he sleeps at
night in a sort of coal-scuttle.&nbsp; Nevertheless the two
together seemed perfectly happy.</p>
<p>By way of variety, the Rob Roy on leaving Margate the next
time set off in the dark night, to sail away under the stars, and
by some curious good luck we managed to pass as close to the buoy
at Reculver as ever one could do in the light.&nbsp; Next time we
came to Margate the place was gay with its Regatta, on a fine
breezy day.&nbsp; It was one of the best managed regattas one
could see, with always something going on, and always the
requisite confusion that prevents anybody from knowing exactly
what <i>is</i> going on.&nbsp; However, the Rob Roy had a
charming sail among the yachts as she towed at her stern the
dingey and a canoe, for the members of our Club are ubiquitous,
<a name="citation287"></a><a href="#footnote287"
class="citation">[287]</a> so two of them are at Margate.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Worcester&mdash;Swedish lesson&mdash;English

prophecy&mdash;Letter&mdash;Request&mdash;Reply&mdash;The
&lsquo;Dolphin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margate has often been abused, laughed at, and snubbed, but it
has never yet been properly described.&nbsp; How shall I describe
Margate?&nbsp; It is too difficult to do well, and it has been
too often done badly to do it again.</p>
<p>The men&rsquo;s bathing here from boats with steps, like those
at Malta, is sensible enough.&nbsp; Fine bold swimmers struck out
well beside me in the water while I had my morning dip from the
yawl.&nbsp; As for the epicene bathing&mdash;masculine women and
womanish males who partake of &ldquo;sea-bathing by
machinery&rdquo;&mdash;separate machines, but that is
all&mdash;let us ignore them.</p>
<p>Come rather back to France, and let us look at Her Imperial
Majesty the Empress Eugenie in the water, as we have seen her
years ago.</p>
<p>It was at Biarritz, and one day a commotion in the town was
evident, but &ldquo;What is about to <!-- page 289--><a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>happen?&rdquo; we asked, being ready for any response
as a traveller ought to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her Majesty is going to bathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>British modesty urged a quiet retreat, but French system being
different, we spectators to the number of some hundreds were
ranged along the sands in two long lines, with a narrow lane
clear between, and grave Gendarmes keeping the ranks in
order.</p>
<p>The usual proceedings one sees at French bathing towns were
all in action round about us.&nbsp; Ladies dressed to the highest
pitch, mingled with others in bathing costume.&nbsp; Gentlemen
walking quite composed and dripping wet with ladies just come out
of the sea and just going in again.&nbsp; Young girls in canoes
boldly paddling, and gaily upsetting the little craft, while they
swam alongside.&nbsp; Rafts with men and women, half-floating as
they held by the sides, and chattered and basked in the
sun.&nbsp; All this difficult interlude on dry-land manners was
conducted with perfect decorum, a telling lesson to Britons who
bathe.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, we should not like to see our Royal Family
follow the example of what came next.&nbsp; First there marched
out of the Imperial Villa a number of tall, liveried footmen,
each with a tray or basket piled up high with feminine <!-- page
290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>finery, and this procession wended its way to two
pretty little tents hard by the sea.</p>
<p>Next there appeared the Empress and four maids of honour, who
came also to the tents, the Empress going alone into one with a
tasteful blue and silver drapery round it.&nbsp; See, now the
ladies emerge from their disrobing rooms, and walk slowly down to
the water between the double line of inquisitive but respectful
visitors.&nbsp; Each lady has a coat, vest, and trousers of black
silk, with the neatest of little boots, and the most winning of
large-brimmed black straw hats&mdash;that of the Empress being
trimmed with a narrow band of red.</p>
<p>When they reached the water five big fellows approached, all
dressed in red flannel.&nbsp; These bathing men each proceeded to
tie an empty gourd, like a water-bottle, a sort of
life-preserver, round the waist of a lady, and then, first
politely bowing, he lifted the lady in his arms, as a nurse
catches up a little child, and so with his fair burden he marched
into the waves.</p>
<p>When they were at about four feet deep the man allowed the
lady to float on her back, and with his arms under her arms he
supported her as each wave rose and fell.</p>
<p>All the time of these strange doings there was a large boat
close to the merry party, and with <!-- page 291--><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>several men
in it, who kept beating the water with long poles&mdash;What is
that for?&nbsp; To keep away the sharks. <a
name="citation291"></a><a href="#footnote291"
class="citation">[291]</a>&nbsp; Such is Majesty afloat.&nbsp;
Yes, they do these things better in France!</p>

</a></p>
<p>And now, near the end of our voyage alone, came the
pleasantest part of it all, because the most useful to
others.&nbsp; We had anchored often beside these three ships for
boys, and always with <!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>more delight:&mdash;the
&lsquo;Worcester,&rsquo; for gentlemen cadets; the
&lsquo;Chichester,&rsquo; for homeless boys; and the
&lsquo;Cornwall,&rsquo; for lads sent to her as a Reformatory
ship.</p>
<p>Many of the youngsters now on board the first or the second of
these might have been qualified for the third vessel, but for the
conventions of life and the machinery of education that tries to
keep all &ldquo;wild boys&rdquo; from being classed as
criminals.</p>
<p>Both you and I might have easily strayed into the police dock
or the gaol cell but for a guiding hand, a mother&rsquo;s care, a
sister&rsquo;s love, a father&rsquo;s rod, a home, a competence,
a somebody caring for us, if not a friend.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t
be hard on the boys in the &lsquo;Cornwall&rsquo;; they are our
natural shipmates, and if by God&rsquo;s grace we are not yet
with them, thank Him, help them, and be humble.</p>
<p>Brave lads, there is still a chance for you here.&nbsp;
England is to blame as well as you that you have been sucked by
the eddies of life into criminal streams.&nbsp; England also
rescues you.&nbsp; It is but <i>dragging</i> out indeed, but you
are out of the mire.&nbsp; Take heart, you may carry the British
flag proudly yet; the career of the sailor is open to <i>you</i>
also, and who shall say that some gallant three-master may not
yet be commanded by a sailor bred in the &lsquo;Cornwall&rsquo;
Reformatory school-ship at Purfleet?</p>
<p><!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>As for the &lsquo;Worcester,&rsquo; the lads there are
already well up on the ladder of life.&nbsp; Sometime, if things
go on thus well, we shall have Christian gentlemen as our
sea-captains, for already in many things the waves are better
than the shore.</p>
<p>When the Rob Roy returned from France, we had put on board of
her some fireworks to amuse the &lsquo;Worcesters&rsquo; at
Erith, and in a quiet night the rockets sped aloft, and the Roman
candles ejaculated fireballs, and the Chinese floats spat flame
as they blazed on the flowing tide, and the red light made our
sails blush deeply, and the &ldquo;jack in the box&rdquo; fizzed
and caracoled over the deck scorching us all inordinately.</p>
<p>When everything pyrotechnic was burned out on the yawl, the
show was yet to begin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worcester&rsquo; was not to be beaten by Rob Roy.&nbsp;
Up sprang the blue-lights from her tops and yards.&nbsp; Ports
blazed with lamps, and skyrockets whizzed into the ether.&nbsp;
Then came best of all from young and gladsome hearts those
ringing cheers, and the lively band roused up the quiet night
waves with &ldquo;Rob Roy MacGregor O!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I know a lad for the Merchant Navy, he shall go to it best
taught by companions as well as by officers, in the school for
sea life aboard the &lsquo;Worcester.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>At Greenhithe the &lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; and her
sister ship the &lsquo;Arethusa&rsquo; (presented by the Baroness
Burdett Coutts) are for poor lads without home, without friends,
nay, without hope from man unless you and I will help them.&nbsp;
Can we refuse so strong a plea from England&rsquo;s little
sons?&nbsp; Patriotism, Religion, Duty, and the most unthinking
Love say, No!</p>
<p>Our country just at this time wants more seamen and better
seamen.&nbsp; The Royal Navy needs young England, and the
Commercial Navy <i>will</i> have him, bad or good, ignorant or
well taught.&nbsp; Our Government finding this to be so had
thought of placing Training ships at various ports for the very
purpose of supplying the demand for sailor boys.&nbsp; Doubtless
they would have done this well, but it is better still if by
private effort we can fill the ships.&nbsp; At any rate let us
empty the prisons, the dens of penury, and the kerb-stones, where
the young and prime material, spoiling by ignorance and neglect,
wastes the vigour of our land, pesters this generation with
beggars, poor-rates, and gaols, and infects and ruins the
generation to come after.</p>
<p>Sweden does better by her sons.&nbsp; She teaches them every
one, and, as a Swede told me, &ldquo;Sweden is not rich enough to
keep ignorant children until they are criminal men.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Therefore she gives <!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>every one the priceless boon of
education as a national gift, so that every Swede owes at least
one debt to his country, and there are no Fenians there.</p>
<p>In England no one is allowed to appear in public without some
clothes.&nbsp; The time will come when we shall not dare to let a
man loose on the thoroughfares in native ignorance&mdash;decency
forbids.</p>
<p>We have opened our ship-decks to foreign sailors&mdash;more
proud in our boast of being an asylum for the distressed than in
preventing distress among our own people.&nbsp; By all means give
foreigners fair play, but <i>after</i> England&rsquo;s boys are
cared for.&nbsp; Charity begins at home, our home is
England.&nbsp; English boys are far better sailors than any
foreigners, who no doubt excel us in cookery and silks, and
manners and despotism, but not in the hard duty bravely done,
when storms lash clouds and ocean into one general foam.</p>
<p>To train up English sailor boys philanthropy stepped in just
in time, and in the last few years it has provided more and more
ships.&nbsp; The very boys who are worst off, and most tried by
dire want and misfortune, are those who may be boldest to run
aloft when well taught; and if these British hearts are won
young, and tutored right, and <!-- page 296--><a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>trained
loyal, and warmly clothed in true blue jackets, we shall not have
so many shipwrecks where cheap foreigners skulk as the tempest
roars. <a name="citation296"></a><a href="#footnote296"
class="citation">[296]</a></p>
<p>One day we had a grand treat for the &lsquo;Chichester&rsquo;
boys, who marched to a sunny mead at Greenhithe, and romped for
hours and hours in hearty sailors&rsquo; play.&nbsp; How they ran
races, jumped in sacks, swarmed up the polished pole, and eyed
the leg of mutton at the top, far out of reach, until sheer
exhaustion with boyish laughter made them slide down!&nbsp; Then,
gathered round cake and tea, and duly stuffed therewith to
concert pitch, they sing our grand old Psalms, our free and
joyous loyal ship-songs, the orchestra of young throats being
directed with all gravity by an urchin&mdash;one of
themselves&mdash;a miniature &ldquo;Costa&rdquo; full of
pound-cake, and with his Jersey pockets bulged out too, but
tuneful enough after his tea.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s heart that is
not softened, gladdened, and strung to effort for these little
fellows by scenes like this I do not covet.</p>
<p>The captain of the &lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I receive very pleasing letters from boys
who have left.&nbsp; <!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>I send you a copy of the last, just
arrived, which I think is as powerful an appeal in our behalf as
any that could be penned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship &lsquo;---,&rsquo; off the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Please Sir</span>,&mdash;I take the
pleasure of writing these few lines to you, hoping to find you in
good health, as we are.&nbsp; We are getting on very well, we are
now off the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; Sir, we like our ship very well,
and I hope we shall have a good character when we come
home.&nbsp; I hope all the Instructors are well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give my respects to Lady Alston, and tell her where we
are.&nbsp; We are having very good weather, and I haven&rsquo;t
forgot my Bible.&nbsp; C. D. sends his respects to you.&nbsp;
Please sir, will you give my love to Frances.&nbsp; Sir, you must
excuse me for not writing more.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t had
time.&nbsp; Sir, if I don&rsquo;t see you any more in this world,
I hope I shall Above.&nbsp; Give my respects to Mr. and Mrs.
Macarthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more at present from your obedient servants,</p>
<p>&ldquo;A. B. and C. D.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be merciful to us as sinners.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And while we speak more of the three ships already named,
because they are nearest, and so are most seen by us Londoners,
remember there are other stout Britons at Hull, sturdy boys in
the Mersey, sea-urchins in the Clyde, and good sailor-hearts in
Ireland and in Welshmen&rsquo;s breasts, and there are training
ships for boys in all these and other places, <a
name="citation297"></a><a href="#footnote297"
class="citation">[297]</a> so that all may join who wish to <!--
page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>help in England&rsquo;s future, which will much depend
on the next generation of British seamen.</p>
<p>It will be a happy sight, and one by no means out of our reach
to witness, when the gentlemen taught on the
&lsquo;Worcester,&rsquo; and the mates from the
&lsquo;Chichester,&rsquo; and the crew from the
&lsquo;Cornwall,&rsquo; shall man the largest, fastest vessel on
the sea.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; boys make a very appreciative
audience when a visitor addresses them.&nbsp; Then they sing
their hearty thanks with steady voices, and in stanzas of
original poetry spun aboard ship, and sure to mean much if you
can read between the lines; for London boys are both in good
things and in bad the smartest of all.</p>
<p>After pondering on the matter during another sail, the
following letter appeared in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The training ship &lsquo;Chichester,&rsquo;
lately moored at Greenhithe for the reception of homeless boys,
has already produced some of the anticipated good results, and
several young lads, rescued from a life of sorrow and want, have
been sent out as trained sailor boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But although these boys are approved by the
ships&rsquo; captains, it is found that until the boys can be
taught how to steer a vessel, as well as the other duties of a
seaman, they cannot be well received by the rest of a
ship&rsquo;s crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steering is not to be learnt by book or precept only,
or in a ship at moorings; and the suggestion is therefore made
that a small vessel, say a cutter of 20 tons, should be attached
to the &lsquo;Chichester,&rsquo; as a &lsquo;tender.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>&ldquo;The boys could then be taught to handle the
tiller by voyages to the Nore.&nbsp; They would also learn the
use of buoys, beacons, and lights.&nbsp; They would have a
powerful incentive to progress in their book-work, and the
&lsquo;tender&rsquo; would be most useful in carrying officers
and boys and stores to and from London, and thus save
considerable expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This being a new proposal, it will be necessary to have
additional contributions for the purchase of the tender, and as
the funds which provided the &lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; were
received principally from the readers of &lsquo;The Times,&rsquo;
perhaps we may venture to hope for the same kind aid in launching
the new suggestion.&nbsp; Contributions may be sent to the Hon.
Secretary, Mr. W. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>, St.
Giles&rsquo; Refuge, Great Queen Street, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
Fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J. M.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Margate Roads</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We expect much from Englishmen when an appeal is made to their
generous hearts, but it was certainly beyond our hopes that in a
few days afterwards the following letter could be
published:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In reply to the appeal through your
columns, for means to provide a tender for the
&lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; school ship, the Rev. C. Harrington,
Rector of Bromsgrove, has presented to the institution the
&lsquo;Dolphin,&rsquo; a strong, well-built, sea-going yacht of
20 tons, with all her stores complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The committee in accepting this gift, have abundant
reason to thank the kind donor, and the friends of
&lsquo;Homeless Boys&rsquo; owe another debt of gratitude to
&lsquo;The Times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;J. M.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Temple</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>By the desire of the &lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; Committee
I joined the &lsquo;Dolphin&rsquo; at Sheerness, and with a
regular salt captain, and a seaman from the Bendigo diggings, and
a boy from the &lsquo;Chichester,&rsquo; we weighed the
cutter&rsquo;s anchor to bring the prize to Greenhithe.</p>
<p>The pier-man smiled gladly on the gift yacht.&nbsp; The taut
Guard-ship bristling with big guns seemed to look down kindly on
the little vessel, and even the grim old hulks, otherwise sulky
enough, appeared to wish her well as she loosed her white sails
to a gentle breeze.&nbsp; Yes, and the sun smiled brightly, too,
with a balmy day like summer again.</p>
<p>Barges flocked out, clustering on the water as in my former
visits here, yet the &lsquo;Dolphin&rsquo; mingled with them not
as in a mere play, but with a benign and holy purpose in her
gait, for it was the gracious breath of Christian benevolence
that wafted the &lsquo;Dolphin&rsquo; on.&nbsp; She was a present
to the homeless boys, and so a gift that shall be one time repaid
by the Friend of the friendless with measure &ldquo;running
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yantlet was passed and the Blythe and Jenkin, when sunset
shrouded sleeping Father Thames.&nbsp; Then the ship-lights
sparkled numerous on the stream, and red rays from the beacons
glinted athwart our sail.&nbsp; Swift steamers whisked by in <!--
page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>the dark.&nbsp; Tall, gaunt, sailing ships rustled
their dusky canvas, and struggling little tug-boats rattled with
instant paddle as they passed.</p>

<p>Clouds withdrew from above as we neared the
&lsquo;Chichester,&rsquo; and the full moon came out and looked
upon the &ldquo;gift for boys&rdquo; with her long pendant
streaming in the mild and onward breeze.</p>
<p>Then, to me silent, lying on the deck as if in a summer eve,
came many-coloured thoughts&mdash;the Rob Roy&rsquo;s rovings by
river and sea in brightsome <!-- page 302--><a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>days and
thundering nights, the good seed sown by the shore, the thousand
incidents of a charming voyage.</p>
<p>But best of them all was the sail in the
&lsquo;Dolphin.&rsquo;</p>

the three is charity in</p>

<p><i>There are Five regular Boys&rsquo; Training Ships for the
Royal Navy</i>, <i>accommodating</i> 3400 <i>boys</i>.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Impregnable,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Implacable&rsquo;
(with &lsquo;Lion&rsquo;), at Devonport (for 700 boys);
&lsquo;Ganges,&rsquo; at Falmouth (500 boys); <!-- page 306--><a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>&lsquo;St.
Vincent,&rsquo; at Portsmouth (700 boys); and
&lsquo;Boscawen,&rsquo; at Portland (500 boys).&nbsp; To each is
attached a brig for cruising during the summer months.&nbsp; The
boys go through a regular course of instruction at school, in
seamanship and in gunnery, till they are &ldquo;rated,&rdquo;
after a year or a little more, as 1st Class boys, when they have
a cruise in the brig.&nbsp; With respect to the school
instruction, the principle is to give the more backward boys more
schooling than the more advanced, and to this end the boys are
divided into Upper School and Lower School: the Upper School boys
have one forenoon and one afternoon a week in school, and the
Lower School boys twice that amount.&nbsp; The educational
attainments of the Upper School correspond to Standards VI., V.,
IV. of the New Code, and those of the Lower School to Standards
III. and II.&nbsp; Of course there is the division into watches,
as the routine of the ships is modelled on that of a
man-of-war.</p>
<p>With the exception of the band boys entered from industrial
schools, no boys are received who have been before a
magistrate.&nbsp; It is gratifying to find that as many good and
respectable lads as are wanted can be had for this glorious
patriotic service.&nbsp; &ldquo;The expense incurred in training
seamen amounts on an average to not less than &pound;300 to
&pound;400 for every seaman in the navy:&rdquo; &lsquo;British
Seamen,&rsquo; by T. Brassey, M.P.&nbsp; Longmans, 1877, page
158.</p>
<p>For training young officers there is the

<h4>&lsquo;AKBAR.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Mersey</span>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1856.</p>
<p>The vessel is managed by &ldquo;The Liverpool Juvenile
Reformatory Association,&rdquo; which has also a girls&rsquo;
reformatory and a farm school.&nbsp; The report for December 31,
1877, shews <!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>that during the year 79 boys were
admitted between 11 and 17 years of age (all of them under
sentence of a magistrate), and 59 were discharged (of whom 43
went to sea), leaving 198 in the ship and about 100 besides
&ldquo;under detention,&rdquo; or on license elsewhere.&nbsp; The
total number admitted since 1856 was 1393, of whom 731 went to
sea, 130 went to friends, 73 were transferred, and 59 died.</p>
<p>In January, 1878, the ship parted from her moorings in a gale,
and this and repairs caused an expense of about &pound;500.&nbsp;
The ordinary expenditure of the year is about &pound;3800; the
average number on board is 190, and of these 134 could swim.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;ARETHUSA.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Greenhithe</span>, <i>Thames</i>.)</h4>
<p>Opened August, 1874.</p>
<p>This vessel is the new sister ship of the
&lsquo;Chichester,&rsquo; and is described below with the other
vessel.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;CHICHESTER.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Greenhithe</span>, <i>Thames</i>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1866.</p>
<p>This vessel, together with the &lsquo;Arethusa&rsquo; (already
mentioned above), is managed by a committee in connection with
the &ldquo;National Refuges,&rdquo; an institution which
comprises a Refuge for homeless boys, a Refuge for homeless
girls, a &ldquo;Farm school and Shaftesbury school,&rdquo; at
Bisley, Surrey, a &ldquo;Working Boys&rsquo; Home,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Girls&rsquo; Home&rdquo; at Ealing and Sudbury.&nbsp; In
these six homes and two ships are more than 1000 inmates, and the
expense is defrayed by voluntary contributions.&nbsp; The Earl of
Shaftesbury, K. G., is President of the Institution, and Mr. W.
Williams (9, Southampton Street, Bloomsbury Square), is the
Secretary.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; was fitted up in 1866, and opened
in January, 1867, for training homeless boys between 13 and <!--
page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>16 years of age for sea life.&nbsp; By the munificent
gift of the Baroness Burdett Coutts, the &lsquo;Arethusa&rsquo;
was presented to the committee fully fitted up as an additional
Training Ship, in 1874, and the two vessels are moored close
together near the pleasant hills of Greenhithe, in Kent.&nbsp;
The woodcut on the preceding page, representing some boys on the
topsail-yard of the &lsquo;Chichester,&rsquo; appeared in the
<i>Leisure Hour</i> as one of the illustrations of an article on

<p>The number of boys sent to sea from the
&lsquo;Chichester&rsquo; in the year 1877 was 117, and the number
on board 176.&nbsp; The total number of boys received on the
&lsquo;Chichester,&rsquo; up to the 31st of December, 1877, was
2165.&nbsp; Number discharged, 2092; sent to sea, 1797.</p>
<p>Besides the number sent on a first voyage, the following
numbers were re-shipped, not counting those who after their first
voyage got ships without coming to the &lsquo;Chichester&rsquo;
ship-master.&nbsp; Shipped for second voyage, 686; for third,
451; fourth, 291; fifth, 180; sixth, 108; seventh, 72; eighth
voyage, 55.</p>
<p>The total number of boys received on board the
&lsquo;Arethusa&rsquo; from 1874 to end of 1877, was 659;
discharged, 450; sent to sea, 386, of whom 102 were so sent in
1877.&nbsp; In July, 1878, there were 400 boys on the two ships
when the annual presentation of prizes took place.&nbsp; The
total expenses for the two ships for the year 1877 amounted to
&pound;10,494 10<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>I had again the privilege of presenting the sailor boys
&lsquo;Rob Roy&rsquo; prizes in the Guildhall, in the presence of
the veteran philanthropist the Earl of Shaftesbury, in 1880.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;CLARENCE.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span

<p>Established 1863.</p>
<p>This is a Reformatory School Ship for Roman Catholic
boys.&nbsp; The average number on board this vessel is 200, and
<!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>the cost &pound;20 per head per annum, paid chiefly by
the Treasury.&nbsp; In the year 1877, 80 boys had been admitted,
of whom 54 were from Liverpool, and the rest from 15 other towns;
47 of them had not been previously convicted, 58 were sent to sea
&ldquo;on license.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the preceding three years 192
had been discharged, of whom 150 were &ldquo;doing well&rdquo; at
the beginning of 1878, while 5 were &ldquo;doubtful,&rdquo; 8
reconvicted, 10 dead, and 19 &ldquo;unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>&lsquo;CLIO.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Menai
Straits</span>.)</h4>
<p>Certified February, 1878.</p>
<p>This vessel is for 200 boys (from 11 to 15 years of age), sent
under the Industrial Schools Act, or partly paid for otherwise,
and the ship is managed by &ldquo;The North Wales, City of
Chester, and Border Counties Industrial School Training Ship
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first boy was admitted in September,
1877, and on the 13th of July, 1878, there were 197 boys on
board; of these, 8 are &ldquo;voluntary.&rdquo;&nbsp; About 80
were from London, 50 from Manchester, 26 from Liverpool, and the
rest from ten other places.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;CONWAY.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Mersey</span>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1859.</p>
<p>A new vessel (late the &lsquo;Nile&rsquo;) was substituted in
1877 for the old &lsquo;Conway,&rsquo; but it was rechristened
with the old name, and the cost of alterations was
&pound;6000.</p>
<p>It is managed by &ldquo;The Mercantile Marine
Association,&rdquo; and is intended chiefly to supply officers
for the merchant navy.&nbsp; Boys are received from 12 to 16
years of ago.&nbsp; The average number of boys on board was 138,
of whom 54 joined the merchant service.&nbsp; The number of boys
received since <!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>the commencement up to 1877, was
1290, of whom 40 entered the Royal Navy, and almost all the
others went into the Merchant Service.</p>
<p>The report gives no balance-sheet, but says that the school
fees (40 guineas per annum for each boy) &ldquo;covered the
expenses&rdquo; (presumably the ordinary expenses), and left a
balance of &pound;283.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;CORNWALL.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Purfleet</span>, <i>Thames</i>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1859.</p>
<p>This is a Reformatory Ship, managed by &ldquo;The School Ship
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; The boys enter between 13 and 15 years of
age, sentenced to 3 years&rsquo; detention under the Reformatory
Schools Act.&nbsp; The average number of boys maintained on board
in 1877 was 218.&nbsp; Comparative cost per head on ordinary
maintenance and management &pound;32.&nbsp; Industrial profits,
&pound;329.&nbsp; Of cases discharged in 1874, 1875, and 1876,
there were doing well (December, 1877) 198, doubtful 5, convicted
of crime 4, unknown 18, dead 12.&nbsp; In July, 1878, the Captain
had heard of 114 boys at sea service, all doing well, and 26 boys
visited in June, equally satisfactory, one of them in command of
a large ship.</p>
<p>An epidemic in 1875&ndash;76 caused much trouble and
expense.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;CUMBERLAND.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Clyde</span>.)</h4>
<p>Established June, 1869.</p>
<p>This is an Industrial School Ship.&nbsp; At the beginning of
1877 there were 385 boys on board, and during the year 133 were
admitted, 105 were sent to sea, 11 to shore employment, 5 to
their friends, 1 to a school, 6 absconded, and 1 died, leaving
389 on the roll for January 1, 1878.&nbsp; From the <!-- page
312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>establishment up to that time, 1343 boys had been
admitted, and 954 had left.&nbsp; Of 432 discharged in 1874,
1875, and 1876, 345 were known to be doing well, 10
indifferently, 3 convicted of crime, and 16 died of disease and
casualties.&nbsp; The receipts for the year were &pound;7280,
including &pound;500 on contingency account.&nbsp; The ship is
managed by a committee, of which the President is Mr. John Burns,
of Castle Wemyss, who is well known for his important position as
chairman of The Cunard Company (Limited), and for his hearty
liberal efforts on behalf of boys who need a friend.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;ENDEAVOUR.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Feltham</span>, <i>Middlesex</i>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1866.</p>
<p>This is a &ldquo;land ship,&rdquo; with boats on the river,
and the following description of it is from a paper by Captain
Brookes, Royal Marines, the Superintendent of the
&ldquo;Middlesex Industrial Schools at Feltham,&rdquo; where
about 800 boys sent by magistrates are trained for the Army, the
Navy, and various other modes of life:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 150 boys composing the Nautical Section are dressed
as sailors, and their everyday life is assimilated as much as
possible to what it would be in a stationary Training
Ship&mdash;they sleep in hammocks, live in messes, and are daily
exercised in seamanship on board the full-sized model brig
&lsquo;Endeavour,&rsquo; built on play-ground.&nbsp; Boats are
provided on the river at Staines for instruction in rowing, and
the boys are taught to swim in a large swimming bath in the
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brig was built in 1866, between which date and the
end of last year 748 boys (about an average of 70 per annum) have
been trained and sent to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a home at Poplar for the reception and care of
boys about to be sent to sea under the charge of the shipping
<!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>officer, who is duly licensed by the Board of
Trade.&nbsp; This is a most valuable branch of the school,
offering a home to lads returning from sea, who would otherwise
fall into the hands of low lodging-house keepers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The school authorities constantly receive the most
favourable accounts of the lads thus sent to sea, who are well
reported on by captains of ships both as regards character and
ability in seamanship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result of this experiment, now extending over a
period of ten years, proves beyond question that boys can be as
speedily and efficiently trained on board a model training ship
built on land, as on board a stationary one moored in a harbour
or river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This opinion has been fully and publicly endorsed by
Captain Burney, R.N., Superintendent of the Royal Hospital School
at Greenwich, where a large model full-rigged ship (most complete
and thorough in all its arrangements) has been built, and by
means of which, he maintains, he can prepare boys for sea as
efficiently as on board a floating training ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this, as in many other matters, there is a great
deal of popular prejudice to overcome, and perhaps the most
effective way to do so would be by inducing the governing bodies
of such schools as Eton, Harrow, and Rugby to erect model
training ships on their grounds for the use of their boys.&nbsp;
It cannot be doubted that these ships would be as popular amongst
them as their present School Volunteer Corps undoubtedly
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>[After many visits to the floating training ships, and
inspection of the &lsquo;Endeavour,&rsquo; and of the Greenwich
School, where 1000 boys are trained for sea without the expense
and inconveniences of a ship, I fully concur in the opinions of
Captain Brookes and Capt. Burney, C.B., and I consider that the
best mode of training boys for the commercial navy is to have a
<!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>light and roomy building on shore with one or more
&ldquo;tender&rdquo; brigs for cruising, and plenty of boats, and
a good gymnasium and swimming bath.&nbsp; A floating hulk is more
costly to maintain.&nbsp; It is inconvenient for education from
want of light below, and for exercise all the winter from wet
decks above, and moreover, the need of a &ldquo;tender&rdquo; for
each hulk is already acknowledged, so that her sheet anchor is
only sentiment.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">J. Macgregor</span>.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;ENDEAVOUR.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Land
Ship</span>.)</h4>
<p>About thirty-five years ago, this land-ship, with masts and
sails and guns, was set up at the Norwood Poor Law Establishment,
by the exertions of the late Sir J. K. Shuttleworth, Bart., and
one somewhat similar and useful (to a certain extent) was
established in a Union School at Stepney.&nbsp; Of the boys
instructed by this means, 95 out of 100 voluntarily entered the
Army or Navy, but doubtless the supply for sea life is now better
obtained from establishments more distinctly nautical.&nbsp; In
the report of the North Surrey District Schools &ldquo;the mast
and shrouds&rdquo; of the Land Ship there are said to be useful
in inducing boys to go to sea.&nbsp; (<i>Times</i>, September 3,
1878.)</p>
<h4>&lsquo;EXMOUTH.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Grays</span>, <i>Thames</i>.)</h4>
<p>This vessel accommodates 600 boys, and was substituted for
&lsquo;The Goliath,&rsquo; which was burned two years ago (as was
also the old &lsquo;Warspite&rsquo; at Charlton).&nbsp; The
latest report (which is more full and clear than that of several
other ships) deals with the ten months ending the 31st of
December, 1877, when 545 boys were under training.&nbsp; These
were sent from the Poor Law Unions of Poplar, St. Pancras,
Stepney, Marylebone, Woolwich, and others, under the special Act,
<!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>which very properly requires Metropolitan Parishes to
contribute towards the maintenance of the ship, whether they use
it or not.&nbsp; A brigantine, the &lsquo;Steadfast,&rsquo; is
attached as a &ldquo;training tender,&rdquo; and accommodates
thirty boys, who cruise in the Mouth of the Thames for a week at
a time, when ten of them are changed.&nbsp; A causeway from the
shore improves the approach to the &lsquo;Exmouth,&rsquo; and a
small house and office near the London Docks enables eight boys
to be taken daily for engagement in ships.</p>
<p>From March, 1876, to December, 1877, 689 boys were admitted,
seventy-nine were discharged to sea service, twenty-one to the
Army as musicians, forty-three to their respective Unions, and
one absconded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every boy in the ship soaps and washes himself <i>all
over</i> every morning with carbolic soap, and then goes through
a plunge bath under inspection, having a clean towel every time
he washes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lads are remarkably
healthy&mdash;there was not one death in the year.&nbsp; The
charge for maintenance and clothing has been at the rate of
1<i>s.</i> per head per day.&nbsp; The swimming bath is sixty
feet long by thirty feet broad, and the boys are classed by the
number of &ldquo;bath-lengths&rdquo; they can swim at a
stretch.&nbsp; At the beginning of the swimming season, 340 could
not swim at all, but there were only 56 in this predicament at
the end of the season.&nbsp; Music is taught carefully, and a
band of about 60 boys plays twice a week for the other boys to
dance.&nbsp; Of 242 boys absent from one to seven days to see
their friends, only one broke his leave, and he absconded
altogether.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;FAME.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Greenwich
Royal Hospital School</span>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1872.</p>
<p>This land ship is part of the splendid establishment at
Greenwich for training sons of seamen and marines of the Royal
Navy.&nbsp; Candidates must be between 10&frac12;; and 13 years
<!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>of age, physically fit, able to read an easy sentence,
and with some knowledge of arithmetic.</p>
<p>The origin of the school was in 1692, when, after the victory
of &ldquo;La Hogue,&rdquo; an asylum was established for
seamen&rsquo;s widows and orphans at the suggestion of Queen
Mary, who died before it was accomplished.</p>
<p>In 1712 ten boys were instructed (in the buildings of the
present Naval College, part of which had been erected in 1618),
and in 1783 there were 60 boys.&nbsp; In 1805, there were 200
boys, and the institution was no longer a charity, but admitted
officers&rsquo; sons.</p>
<p>Another school, &ldquo;The British Endeavour,&rdquo; started
in 1798 as a private venture in London, was transferred to public
management in Greenwich.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Royal Naval Asylum,&rdquo; for 680 boys and 200
girls, aided by Parliamentary grant, was amalgamated in 1821 with
the other (the Royal Hospital School), forming a &ldquo;Lower
School&rdquo; and &ldquo;Upper School&rdquo; for 1000 boys, in
the quadrangle now occupied opposite the Royal Naval
College.&nbsp; In 1841 the girls&rsquo; school ceased.&nbsp; In
1860 the distinction between &ldquo;Upper&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Lower&rdquo; School was given up.</p>
<p>In 1870 industrial work was introduced in addition to the
other instruction, and the splendid land ship &lsquo;Fame&rsquo;
was erected in 1872, which, with boats on the river, large sized
moveable models in lofty halls, and a fine swimming bath,
gymnasium, class-rooms, and workshops, are the means for
instructing 1000 boys most admirably under the supervision of
Captain Burney, C.B., and an energetic staff.&nbsp; From the
report of July, 1878, it appears that there were 39 pupil
teachers, and 958 boys between 10 and 15 years of age.&nbsp;
Total 997 in the school.&nbsp; The number of boys admitted during
the year was 334, number discharged 333, of whom 99 went into Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Service, and 4 died; 329 boys between 13 and 15
years of age now in the School, have signed continuous service
engagements to serve in the Royal <!-- page 317--><a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>Navy for 10
years from the age of 18.&nbsp; The boys&rsquo; industrial work
in about 30 departments of useful labour is of great value to the
school, so that the annual cost (exclusive of new buildings, but
including all repairs) is under &pound;18 per head.</p>
<p>The punishments are under 1 per cent., and 45 per cent. of the
boys can swim.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;FORMIDABLE.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Portishead</span>, <i>Bristol Channel</i>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1869.</p>
<p>This is an &ldquo;Industrial School Ship&rdquo; for boys
between the ages of 11 and 14 years.&nbsp; During the eighteen
months ending December 31, 1877, 84 boys had been admitted
(including 41 from the London School Board), 18 from Bristol, and
the rest from ten other towns, with 2 &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo;
boys.</p>
<p>Of these there had been discharged during the eighteen months,
81 to the Merchant Service, 2 to the Royal Navy, 26 to friends, 5
to the Army, 13 elsewhere, and 2 died.&nbsp; The number of boys
on board December 31, 1877, was 324.&nbsp; From the commencement
of the ship, 800 boys had been admitted, including 50
&ldquo;volunteers,&rdquo; and of these 366 had gone to the
Merchant Service, and 27 to the Royal Navy, while 11 died.&nbsp;
The receipts for the year, including &pound;1500 from the
Treasury, and &pound;600 from annual subscriptions, amounted to
&pound;8213.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;GIBRALTAR.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Belfast</span>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1872.</p>
<p>This Industrial School Ship for Protestant boys is called
&ldquo;The Ulster Training Ship for Homeless and Destitute
Boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; The number on board the 31st of December,
1877, was 289, of whom about half could read, write, and cipher
well; 64 had been admitted during the year, nearly all of them
from Antrim, <!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>and of these, 33 could not read or
write at all, while only 7 could read, write, and cipher well; 32
of these had lost their fathers, and 18 were orphans.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;HAVANNAH.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Cardiff</span>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1855.</p>
<p>This is an old &ldquo;man-of-war,&rdquo; banked round, so as
to be a &ldquo;land ship,&rdquo; with a causeway to the shore,
and it accommodates about 70 boys, many of whom have industrial
employment in gardening and as porters, &amp;c.&nbsp; Of the 66
boys discharged in the three years, 1874, 1875, 1876, 58 were
known to be earning honest livelihoods, 2 were convicted, 2
unknown, and 4 have died.&nbsp; According to the report of
August, 1878, 68 boys were in the ship, of whom 61 were sent
under the Industrial Schools Act.&nbsp; There were 2 on license,
and 7 appeared to be voluntary cases.&nbsp; The expenditure in
1876 was about &pound;1500, but &pound;200 was earned by the
Industrial Department.&nbsp; In that year 3 boys went to sea, and
in 1878 6 boys.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;INDEFATIGABLE.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Mersey</span>.)</h4>
<p>This vessel was established in 1864 to train orphan and
destitute boys for sea&mdash;boys from the port of Liverpool
having a preference.&nbsp; The report issued in March, 1878,
shewed the average number on board to be 250, of whom 80 had lost
both parents.&nbsp; About 50 boys go out to life each year.&nbsp;
The funds are from voluntary contributions, and about &pound;5000
a year is expended.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;MARS.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Dundee</span>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1869.</p>
<p>This is an &ldquo;Industrial School Ship,&rdquo; under the Act
of Parliament, and it has a &ldquo;tender,&rdquo; &ldquo;which
makes men of the youngsters; she has just brought 100 tons of
coals to us from <!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>Shields (July 5, 1878).&rdquo;&nbsp;
The accommodation is for 350 boys.&nbsp; In 1877, 122 boys were
admitted and 95 discharged, leaving 350 on the register, while
&ldquo;there is great pressure for admission.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the
95 boys, 6 entered the Royal Navy, 55 the Merchant Service as
first class boys, 27 went to shore trades (but seven of these
returned and went to sea), and 7 died.&nbsp; One-third of the
boys admitted were unable to read at all; of 309 discharged
during 3 years, 248 were &ldquo;doing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expenses in 1877 were about &pound;6800.</p>
<p>Donations and subscriptions about &pound;1700.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;MOUNT EDGCUMBE.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span

<p>Established June, 1877.</p>
<p>An Industrial School Ship for boys from Devonshire and
Cornwall.&nbsp; The boys admitted up to July, 1878, were 201; 1
had been discharged, 6 transferred, and 2 died.&nbsp; The number
of &ldquo;voluntary cases&rdquo; (from 12 to 14 years old) was 3,
and the number of all on board 195.&nbsp; Half of these could
read &ldquo;fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>&lsquo;SHAFTESBURY.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Grays</span>, <i>Thames</i>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1878.</p>
<p>The School Board for London has found it necessary to have a
training ship of its own.&nbsp; More than 500 boys sent at the
instance of the Board were in training on board the
&lsquo;Formidable,&rsquo; &lsquo;Wellesley,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Southampton,&rsquo; &amp;c., at distant ports, where
visitation and supervision could not be readily exercised.&nbsp;
After more than six years of experience in regard to training
boys for sea, the Board decided to establish their own ship in
the Thames.&nbsp; The Admiralty was unable or at least declined
to lend one of the few old hulks at their disposal, so the School
<!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>Board purchased for &pound;7000 the P. and O. iron
steamship &lsquo;Nubia,&rsquo; and at an additional expense of
more than &pound;30,000, she was fitted up and moored in a berth
prepared for her in July, 1878, close to the Poor Law ship
&lsquo;Exmouth,&rsquo; so as to accommodate 450 boys to be sent
under the Industrial Schools Act at the instance of the
Board.&nbsp; She is &lsquo;certified&rsquo; for 350 boys, of whom
70 may be Roman Catholics.&nbsp; The first 6 boys were sent on
board her on August 15, 1878.&nbsp; The vessel was rechristened
with the name of &lsquo;Shaftesbury,&rsquo; in honour of one who
is everywhere known as the friend of the hapless and the patron
of everything good.&nbsp; The vessel is longer and narrower than
those of the old &ldquo;man-of-war&rdquo; type, and her four
decks are lofty, giving plenty of light and air for educational
and sanitary purposes, although the wider space for drill above
all is necessarily curtailed.&nbsp; The cost of the vessel
(including purchase) is repayable in 50 years by annual
instalments, with interest at 3&frac12; per cent.</p>
<p>The Shaftesbury has now her full number of 500 boys (May
1880.)</p>
<h4>&lsquo;SOUTHAMPTON.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span class="smcap">The
Humber</span>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1868.</p>
<p>The management is amalgamated with that of &ldquo;The Hull
Ragged and Industrial Schools.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the beginning of
1877, 234 boys were on board (all of them under the Industrial
Schools Act), and 62 were admitted during the year (30 from 10 to
12, and 32 from 12 to 14 years of age), while 56 were discharged,
of whom 27 went to sea, and 23 were returned to friends.&nbsp; Up
to the end of that year 426 boys had been finally discharged from
the ship.&nbsp; Half of these on entry could not read, write, or
cipher, but all learned to do so.&nbsp; Many of the boys were
sent at the instance of the School Board for London and eight
other School Boards.&nbsp; The expenditure for the year was
&pound;6000.</p>
<h4><!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 321</span>&lsquo;WARSPITE.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Charlton</span>, <i>Thames</i>.)</h4>
<p>The Marine Society established its first ship the
&lsquo;Beatty,&rsquo; with a crew of 40 boys, 120 years ago, and
it has since sent to sea about 60,000 boys trained for
sailors&rsquo; life.&nbsp; The new ship, a fine two decker (late
&lsquo;Conqueror&rsquo;), in substitution for the old
&lsquo;Warspite&rsquo; (which was burned), and rechristened with
that name, had 156 boys on board in January, 1877.&nbsp; 304 were
afterwards admitted, 43 were sent to the Royal Navy, and 137 to
the Merchant Service, leaving 269 on board at the beginning of
the year 1878.&nbsp; Most of these are orphans or boys deserted
by their parents.&nbsp; Out of 123 boys who returned in that year
from first voyages, 117 had &ldquo;very good&rdquo; on their
certificates.&nbsp; The age for admission is from 13 to 16,
height from 4 feet 8 inches; 93 boys learned to swim last
summer.&nbsp; The expenditure during the year was &pound;11,000,
including &pound;3000 for fitting up the new ship.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;WELLESLEY.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span class="smcap">South
Shields</span>.)</h4>
<p>Established 1868.</p>
<p>This vessel is for homeless and destitute boys unconvicted of
crime, but who are sent under the Industrial Schools Act, at the
instance of one of the ten or more School Boards which have
agreements with &ldquo;The &lsquo;Wellesley&rsquo; Training Ship
Institution,&rdquo; or who come individually.&nbsp; From the
report in June, 1877, it appears that in the twelve months
preceding, 91 boys had been received, and 59 were discharged, of
whom 45 went to sea.&nbsp; This left 307 boys on board.&nbsp; Of
the boys discharged during 3 years, 83 per cent. were
&ldquo;doing well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since the commencement of the
Institution 702 boys had been received.&nbsp; About &pound;1000
had been contributed by the School Boards during the year, and
&pound;90 for &ldquo;voluntary boys,&rdquo; each of whom is
received for &pound;20 <i>per annum</i>.&nbsp; The maintenance
account for the year was about &pound;5000.</p>

class="pagenum">p.
322</span>&lsquo;WORCESTER.&rsquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Thames</span>.)</h4>
<p>This vessel was moored at Greenhithe in 1862; a larger vessel,
a 72-gun frigate of 5000 tons, and rechristened
&lsquo;Worcester,&rsquo; was substituted in 1877.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Worcester&rsquo; provides properly qualified officers for
merchant vessels, and accommodates 200 boys.&nbsp; The terms are,
for boys from 13 to 16 years old, 50 guineas, and for boys from
11 to 13 years old, 45 guineas per annum.</p>
<p>The Board of Trade allows two years passed on the
&lsquo;Worcester&rsquo; to count as one year&rsquo;s sea service,
and Her Majesty gives annually a gold medal to the boy most noted
for good conduct.&nbsp; About 30 boys passed through the ship
last year.</p>

<h3>THE ROB ROY CUISINE.</h3>
<p>This has been designed after numerous experiments with the
various portable cooking-machines which I could procure for
trial, and, as it succeeds better than any of them, and has been
approved by trial in five of my own voyages, and in another to
Iceland, besides shorter trips, and in the <!-- page 323--><a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>Abyssinian
campaign, &amp;c., &amp;c., it may be of some use to describe the
contrivance here.</p>
<p>The object proposed was to provide a light but strong
apparatus which could speedily boil water and heat or fry other
materials even in wet and windy weather, and with fuel enough
carried in itself for several days&rsquo; use.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 is a section of the Rob Roy cuisine as it is made up
for carrying.&nbsp; There is first a strong waterproof bag about
one foot high, and closed at the top by a running cord.&nbsp; At
the bottom is the cuisine itself, <i>a</i>, which occupies a
space of only six inches by three inches (when of smaller size),
and has the various parts packed inside, except the drinking cup
<i>b</i>.</p>
<p>Provisions, such as bread and cold meat or eggs, may bestowed
in the bag above the cuisine, and if the string of it be then
attached to a nail fixed in the boat, the whole will be kept
steady.</p>
<p>For use, when it is desired to boil water, the cuisine being
opened, the lower part is a copper pan, <i>c</i>, fig. 2, with a
handle, <i>e</i>, which can be fixed either into a socket in the
side of the pan, or another socket in the side of the lid, as
represented in figs. 2 and 6.</p>
<p>Three iron legs also fix into sockets and support the pan over
the spirit-lamp, <i>f</i>, by which the pan, two-thirds full of
liquid, will be boiled in five minutes.</p>
<p>The lamp is the main feature of the apparatus, and it is
represented in section in fig. 3.&nbsp; It consists of two
cylinders, one within the other.&nbsp; The space between these
(shaded dark) is closed at top and bottom, and a tube <i>b</i>,
fixed through the bottom, rises with one open end inside, and
another (a small nozzle) curved upwards in the open internal
cylinder.&nbsp; Another tube, <i>h</i>, opens into the annular
chamber between the cylinders, and it has a funnel-shaped mouth
at the outer end, through which the chamber may be filled, while
a screw in the inside allows a handle, fig. 4 (in section), to
have its end, <i>i</i>, screwed in.&nbsp; A small hole in the
upper surface is closed by a little cork, which will be expelled
if the pressure within is so <!-- page 324--><a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>high as to
require escape by this safety-valve.&nbsp; The hole may be in any
part of the annular cover (but is not shown in the sketch), and
in such case the hole shown in the handle is omitted.</p>
<p>The outer cylinder of the lamp, being larger than the inner
one, has a bottom, <i>k</i>, fig. 3, which forms a circular tray
of about two inches wide and half an inch deep.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>The original form of the lamp which was first brought
to notice <a name="citation325"></a><a href="#footnote325"
class="citation">[325]</a> by the Cook of the Royal Canoe Club,
had a detached tray for the bottom, but now, instead of this plan
for the admission of air into the lamp, two saw cuts are made,
each about an inch long.&nbsp; One of them is shown below
<i>f</i>, fig. 2, and thus the lamp and tray are united in one
compact piece while still there is access for air.</p>
<p>To put the lamp in operation, unscrew its handle from the
position in fig. 2, so that it will be as in figs. 3 and 4.&nbsp;
Then from a tin flask (which has been packed with the rest of the
things in the pan) pour spirits of wine&mdash;or, if the odour is
not objected to, methylated spirit, into the measure <i>m</i>,
fig. 5, and from that into the interior of the lamp through the
opening at <i>h</i>.&nbsp; Next screw in the handle, and place
the lamp level under the pan, and pour nearly another measure
full into the interior tray.&nbsp; Set fire to this, and shelter
it for a few seconds if there be much wind.&nbsp; I used this
always with complete success on the Jordan, Nile, Danube, and
many other rivers.</p>
<p>In a short time the flame heats the spirits in the closed
chamber, and the spirituous steam is forced by pressure down the
tube, and inflames at the nozzle, from which it issues with much
force and some noise in a lighted column, which is about one foot
in height when unimpeded.</p>
<p>This powerful flame operates on the whole of the bottom and
lower edge of the pan, and it cannot be blown out by wind nor by
a blast from the mouth, but may be instantly extinguished by
sharply placing the flat bottom of the measure upon it.</p>
<p>The cover may be put on so as to rest with the flat bottom
downwards, and with or without the handle.&nbsp; If tea is to be
made with the water when it boils, the requisite quantity is to
be placed in the tea vessel <i>n</i>, fig. 5, which has
perforated <!-- page 326--><a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>sides, and, its lid being closed,
this is placed in the water, where it will rest on the curved
side, and can be agitated now and then for a minute, after which
insert the handle in the socket of the pan and remove the lamp,
allowing the tea to infuse for four minutes, when the tea vessel
may be removed and the made tea may be poured out into the
cup.&nbsp; The dry tea can be conveniently carried in a paper
inside the tea vessel.&nbsp; Salt is carried in the box <i>o</i>,
and the matches are in the box <i>p</i>.&nbsp; Coffee may be best
carried in the state of essence in a bottle.&nbsp; An egg-spoon
and a soup-spoon are supplied.&nbsp; A flat clasp knife and fork
may be had extra.</p>
<p>If bacon is to be fried, or eggs to be poached or cooked
<i>sur le plat</i>, they may be put into the lid and held by hand
over the lamp-flame, so as to warm all parts equally, or the
slower heat of a simple flame may be employed by lighting the
measure full of spirits and then placing it on the bottom of the
upturned pan as shown at fig. 6, where it will be observed that
the three legs are placed in their sockets with the convex curve
of each turned outward, so that the lid, as a frying-pan, can
rest upon their three points.</p>
<p>The spirit-flask contains enough for six separate charges of
the lamp, and the cost of using methylated spirits at 4<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. a gallon is not one penny a meal.&nbsp; The lamp-flame
lasts from ten to fifteen minutes, and the weight of the
<i>cuisine</i>, exclusive of the bag and cup, is about two
pounds.</p>
<p>These cuisines, improved by the suggestions obtained in their
use, are made at 93, Chancery Lane, London, of the best materials
and workmanship, and at the price of two and a half guineas; or
if with tin boiler instead of copper, and brass lamp, &pound;1
12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d</i>.&nbsp; Many of much larger size (to cook
for twenty men) have been used in Australia.</p>
<p>The lamp above described was used daily in my yawl, but the
other fittings were on a more enlarged scale, as extreme
lightness was not then required.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Cooking Apparatus of another kind entirely <!--
page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>will be a valuable adjunct to the yachtsman&rsquo;s
stores.&nbsp; By means of this, meat or pudding after being
heated for only <i>five minutes</i>, and then enclosed in a box
which retains the heat, will be found to be perfectly cooked
after three hours, though no more heat has been applied to
it.</p>
<h3>IMPROVED ROB ROY BINNACLE AND COMPASS.</h3>
<p>Mr. Dent, of the Strand, has made the Life Boat Liquid Compass
with several improvements suggested from the Rob Roy yawl, and
after experiments permitted by the Life Boat Institution.&nbsp;
These relate to the diagram on the card, the lamp with oil or
candle, the reflectors, the ventilation, and the interior
colouring of the binnacle, as well as other minor matters.&nbsp;
In a second cruise of the yawl with my new binnacle, the great
advantages desired were found to be attained.&nbsp; A
<i>fac-simile</i> of the new Rob Roy card is given in &ldquo;The
Rob Roy on the Jordan,&rdquo; 6th edition.</p>
<h3>SEA DRESS.</h3>
<p>After six long voyages alone, a few remarks may be made on
water toggery.</p>
<p>Flannel all over to begin with.&nbsp; One grey flannel suit of
&ldquo;Norfolk jacket&rdquo; and trousers lasted for three trips,
but at sea the blue colour answers.&nbsp; Straw hat in sun, red
woollen cap in wind, sou&rsquo;wester in rain, thick boating
jacket, and the life-belt over it, and above that an oilskin coat
with overall trousers of the same, will defy wind and
water.&nbsp; Woven waistcoat expanding limitless.&nbsp; Shoes and
not boots for work, white canvas boots with spring sides for show
in port.&nbsp; No braces.&nbsp; Blue seamless yacht jersey a
bore, though smart.&nbsp; Collar only with a calico shirt, and on
Sundays, when that cylinder of discomfort, a black hat, is
exhumed.&nbsp; Watch hanging in cabin, never on the person
afloat.&nbsp; Purse <!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 328</span>with keys in the shelf.&nbsp; Knife
and etceteras in leather pockets of the boat.&nbsp; So clad ye
shall be ready to sail or to swim.</p>
<h3>SWIMMING FOR GIRLS.</h3>
<p>The following appeared in the <i>Times</i>, July 3rd,
1878:&mdash;</p>
<p>Hundreds of girls in London are learning to swim, but many
hundreds more would gladly learn if teachers could be had.&nbsp;
A healthful, cleanly, life-saving exercise like this ought not to
be stinted of teachers.</p>
<p>The boys have twenty public baths to learn in and the open
water in Victoria Park, besides the dangerous, dirty
canals.&nbsp; More than 1500 boys are learning to swim as paying
members of the London Schools Swimming Club, which is open to all
public elementary schools.</p>
<p>Last year a class for thirty girls was begun late in the
season, yet twenty-five of these were taught to swim in six
lessons, and six of them won prizes.</p>
<p>Only five of the public baths are available for girls and
female school teachers.&nbsp; At some of these the charge is
threepence for a bathe, and at one it is a penny for members of
the club.&nbsp; Twelve girls can be well taught in a class.&nbsp;
For a lesson of two hours, one teacher charges fifteen shillings
and another receives ten shillings, while others are paid two
shillings for each girl who is taught to swim twenty-five yards,
and the rest are rewarded by watches and other prizes for those
who teach the most girls to swim.</p>
<p>Mothers and sisters who can swim will not let their boys be
unwashed on the land and drowned in the water.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">J. M.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;London Schools Swimming Club&rdquo; was formed in
1875, and it has already (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1880)
given instruction in swimming to 12,000 boys and girls, and male
and female teachers.</p>

<p><a name="footnote10"></a><a href="#citation10"
class="footnote">[10]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Swinging for the
compass&rdquo; is thus performed.&nbsp; The vessel is moored in
the bight at Greenhithe, and by means of warps to certain
Government buoys she is placed with her head towards the various
points of the compass.&nbsp; The bearing by the compass on board
(influenced by the attraction of the iron she carries) is taken
accurately by one observer in the vessel, and the true bearing is
signalled to him by another observer on shore, who has a compass
out of reach of the &ldquo;local attraction&rdquo; of the
vessel.&nbsp; The error in each position due to the local
attraction is thus ascertained, and the corrections for these
errors are written on a card in a tabulated form,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>And so on.&nbsp; A half point looks a small matter on the
compass card, but in avoiding a shoal, or in finding a harbour,
it makes all the difference.</p>
<p><a name="footnote14"></a><a href="#citation14"
class="footnote">[14]</a>&nbsp; The Reformatory ship
&lsquo;Cornwall&rsquo; is at Purfleet.&nbsp; The three vessels
are within sight of each other.&nbsp; We shall sail back to each
of them in a future page, and have a more leisurely look on
board.</p>
<p><a name="footnote20"></a><a href="#citation20"
class="footnote">[20]</a>&nbsp; The after part of the well is
rounded at each side, and it is all boarded up.&nbsp; In the
middle is a seat on which a large cork cushion can rest, or this
may be thrown over as a life-preserver or for a buoy, while the
life-belt to be worn round the waist is stowed away under the
seat, and an iron basin with a handle is placed alongside it just
over the flooring, below which is seen, at p. 41, a wedge of
lead-ballast, and in front of this the water-well, where water
collecting from leakage or dashing spray is conveniently reached
by the tube of vulcanised india-rubber represented as just in
front.&nbsp; This pump hose has a brass union joint on the top,
to which we can screw the nozzle of a pump with a copper cylinder
(shown at the bottom), or a piston worked by hand (but without
any lever), and when in use the cylinder rests obliquely, so that
the water will flow out over the combing, and on the deck, and so
into the sea.</p>
<p><a name="footnote22"></a><a href="#citation22"
class="footnote">[22]</a>&nbsp; Several important suggestions for
the implement of the lifeboat liquid compass were obtained during
my use of it in this voyage, and these have been duly appreciated
by the Lifeboat Institution.</p>
<p><a name="footnote25"></a><a href="#citation25"
class="footnote">[25]</a>&nbsp; However good the glass, it is
very difficult to make use of it for faint or distant objects on
the horizon, and on the whole I found it easier to discern the
first dim line of land far off by the unaided eye.&nbsp; A slight
mark, that would not be observed while only a short piece of it
is seen in the field of view, becomes decidedly manifest if a
large scope is seen at once.&nbsp; The binocular glass was very
valuable, however, when the words on a buoy, or the colour on the
chequers of a beacon had to be deciphered.</p>
<p><a name="footnote26"></a><a href="#citation26"
class="footnote">[26]</a>&nbsp; See page 44 and Appendix.</p>
<p><a name="footnote32"></a><a href="#citation32"
class="footnote">[32]</a>&nbsp; In yet another, the fourth visit
to this stupid shallow harbour (one of the most unpleasant to lie
in anywhere), I fixed an oar out at each side as a leg, and could
scarcely get rest from the fear that one or other of my beautiful
oars would be snapped as they bent and groaned with remonstrances
against supporting several tons of weight in the capacity of a
wooden leg.</p>
<p><a name="footnote36"></a><a href="#citation36"
class="footnote">[36]</a>&nbsp; I had lessened her ton and a half
of iron ballast by leaving two hundredweight on Dover quay; good
advice agreeing with my own opinion that the Rob Roy was
needlessly stiff.</p>
<p><a name="footnote42"></a><a href="#citation42"
class="footnote">[42]</a>&nbsp; The relative positions of all
these articles had been maturely considered and carefully
arranged, and they were much approved by the most experienced and
critical of the many hundred visitors who inspected the Rob
Roy.</p>
<p><a name="footnote44"></a><a href="#citation44"
class="footnote">[44]</a>&nbsp; In the sketch at page 41, the
cook of the Rob Roy is represented as he works when rain compels
him to shelter himself in the cabin under a tarpaulin, and the
hatch inclined upwards.&nbsp; But usually&mdash;indeed, always
but on two occasions&mdash;he sat in the well while he tended the
caboose.</p>
<p><a name="footnote50"></a><a href="#citation50"
class="footnote">[50]</a>&nbsp; I have read numerous books,
pamphlets, and discussions on this subject, some of which are
wonderfully clear in explaining what is perfectly easy to
understand, while they are exceedingly ingenious in overlooking
the only difficulty, which is, how a man on one vessel is to know
whither another vessel is steering to.&nbsp; (March 1880.)</p>
<p><a name="footnote52"></a><a href="#citation52"
class="footnote">[52]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Caution</i>.&mdash;During strong winds, between W.S.W.,
round westerly, and N.N.W., the coast to the eastward of Ailly
Point is dangerous to be on, and shipwrecks are of frequent
occurrence; vessels therefore of every description at that period
should keep a good offing, and when obliged to approach it, must
do so with great caution; for although the general mass of the
above banks appear to be stationary, yet great attention must be
paid to the lead, and in observing the confused state of the sea
in the various eddies, so as to guard against suddenly meeting
with dangers which may be of recent formation.&nbsp; The lights
for the purpose of pointing out the position of the headlands and
dangers between Capes Antifer and Gris-Nez at night, are so
disposed that in clear weather two can always be seen at a time,
and the greater number of the harbours have one or more tide
lights shown during the time the harbour can be entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important to notice that along the coast, between
Cape de la H&egrave;ve and the town of Ault (a space of 67
miles), the wind, when it blows in a direction perpendicular, or
nearly so, to the direction of the coast, is reflected by the
high cliffs, neutralizing in great measure its original action to
a certain extent in the offing, depending upon the strength of
the wind.&nbsp; It follows from this, that a zone is formed off
the coast and parallel to it (except in front of the wide
valleys, where the direct wind meets with no obstacle), where the
wind is light, the sea much agitated, and the waves run towards
the shore.&nbsp; On the contrary, when the wind forms an acute
angle with the coast, the reflected wind contributes to increase
the direct wind near the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote55"></a><a href="#citation55"
class="footnote">[55]</a>&nbsp; As a precaution, I always put on
the life-belt when I had to reef, as one is liable then to be
jerked overboard; also in strong winds when we ran before them,
because in case of getting over board then, it would be difficult
to catch the yawl by swimming; also at night when sailing, or
when, sleeping on deck, as one might then be suddenly run
down.&nbsp; But with all this prudence it happened that on each
of the three occasions when I did fall into the water, I had not
the life-belt on.&nbsp; The Life-Boat Institution had presented
to me one of their life-jackets&mdash;an invaluable companion if
a long immersion in the water is to be undergone.&nbsp; But for
convenience in working the ropes and sails I was content to use
the less bulky life-belt.&nbsp; It is conveniently arranged, and
you soon forget it as an encumbrance.&nbsp; Indeed on one
occasion I walked up to a house without recollecting that my
life-belt was upon me when ashore!</p>

blows hard from the westward on account of the heavy sea at the
entrance; for should a vessel at that time miss the harbour and
ground upon the rocks off Fagnet Point, she would be totally
lost.&rdquo;</p>

suitable for men with weary bodies and sleepy minds.&nbsp; It is
remarkable to see how much attention these men will pay to the
words of the Bible and the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress.&rsquo;&nbsp; No doubt such readers often read but the
surface-sense of both these books; but then even that sense is
good, and the deeper meaning is better, while the language of
both is superb.</p>

class="footnote">[102]</a>&nbsp; If men&rsquo;s vices are matched
by dogs&rsquo; failings, several of our best virtues are at least
equalled by those in canine characters; especially courage,
fidelity, patience, and forgiveness.&nbsp; It is hard to believe
(even if indeed we are at all warranted in believing) that these
noble animals are done with existence when they die.&nbsp; It is
harder still to see a man cruel to a dog, without feeling pretty
sure that the man is not the better of the two.&nbsp; The dog
life to be seen at the &ldquo;Home for lost dogs&rdquo; is a
study for any thoughtful man.</p>
<p>Six empty collars hang in my own room.&nbsp; Each of them
belonged to successive dogs called &lsquo;Rob,&rsquo; who cruised
with me until they were lost or killed.</p>

that it was the fashion to place the
&ldquo;Emperor&rsquo;s&rdquo; picture over each man&rsquo;s
bed.&nbsp; On one occasion His Majesty happened to notice this
when visiting a guard-room, and he had the whole story explained
to him.&nbsp; The late Prince Imperial also came for a
&lsquo;British Workman,&rsquo; and probably it was pinned behind
His Royal Highness&rsquo; four-poster.&nbsp; He was a member of
the Royal Canoe Club, and one of his canoes was saved from the
fire at the palace of St. Cloud.</p>

French, gentleman of good education called upon him one day, and
happened to look at a French Testament which lay open on the
chimney-piece.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Tiens</i>!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;<i>Paternoster</i> in the Bible?&rdquo; when he saw the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in the printed page.</p>

class="footnote">[119]</a>&nbsp; In this one particular the
canoeist has to trust to the boat-builder.&nbsp; In others, and
in those relating to the rigging and sails especially, I regret
to say that I do not find <i>any</i> builder fulfils those
requirements of strength, lightness, neatness, and simplicity
combined in due proportions, upon which so much of the safety of
a canoe depends, as well as comfort and pleasure in using it
during the many days&rsquo; constant work of a long voyage.&nbsp;
The proper rigging of a canoe, so as to be neither fragile like a
toy nor clumsy in its small details, is well attended to at the
Model Dockyard in Fleet Street.</p>
<p><a name="footnote121"></a><a href="#citation121"
class="footnote">[121]</a>&nbsp; This hankering after Egypt once
more ripened into the cruise of the &ldquo;Rob Roy on the
Jordan,&rdquo; of which the sixth edition appears in April,
1880.</p>
<p><a name="footnote128"></a><a href="#citation128"
class="footnote">[128]</a>&nbsp; These four gentlemen, admitted
to the amateur contests declined to row against four English
watermen.</p>
<p><a name="footnote142"></a><a href="#citation142"
class="footnote">[142]</a>&nbsp; I recollect that old Westminster
Bridge was a very dangerous one for a boat to sail through,
because the joints between the <i>voussoirs</i>, or lines of
stones under the arch, were not horizontal as in most other
bridges, but in an oblique direction, and several times when my
mast has touched one of these it was borne downwards with all the
power of a screw.</p>
<p><a name="footnote150"></a><a href="#citation150"
class="footnote">[150]</a>&nbsp; I found that a common Scotch
plaid, if it was in an inclined position, resisted wet longer
than any other material permeable to air, and it could be readily
dried by hanging it from the mast in the wind.</p>
<p><a name="footnote151"></a><a href="#citation151"
class="footnote">[151]</a>&nbsp; There was another method of
cooking under shelter, and we employed it on the only other
occasion when this had to be done, namely, to shut up the cabin
and to cook inside it, using the portable &ldquo;canoe
cuisine,&rdquo; which is described in the Appendix.&nbsp; But as
this is meant to be employed only on shore, it does not answer
well on board, except in a calm; and, moreover, the heat
generated by the lamp was too much in a small cabin.&nbsp; Even a
single candle heats a small apartment, and it is well known that
a man can get a very good vapour-bath by sitting over a
rushlight, with blankets fastened all round.</p>
<p><a name="footnote152"></a><a href="#citation152"
class="footnote">[152]</a>&nbsp; The best, according to my taste,
were those of &ldquo;Irish stew,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stewed
steak,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mulligatawny,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oxtail,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Vegetable soup,&rdquo; all in the order named.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Preserved peas&rdquo; were not quite so good; but the
other viands were all far better than can be had at any culinary
hotel, and were entirely without that metallic or other
&ldquo;preserved&rdquo; flavour so soon discovered in such
eatables, and even by a palate not fastidious.&nbsp; This
experience was fully confirmed afterwards in my Canoe Cruises in
Holland, in the Orkneys and Shetland, and in the Red Sea, Jordan,
Nile, Abana, Pharpar, and Lake of Galilee.</p>
<p><a name="footnote156"></a><a href="#citation156"
class="footnote">[156]</a>&nbsp; Frenchmen have a trick of
anchoring thus to escape a breeze.&nbsp; We have seen them anchor
on the African coast merely to avoid a hard-looking cloud,
whereas the real danger was in anchoring there at all.</p>
<p><a name="footnote159a"></a><a href="#citation159a"
class="footnote">[159a]</a>&nbsp; See Frontispiece.</p>
<p><a name="footnote159b"></a><a href="#citation159b"
class="footnote">[159b]</a>&nbsp; We shall hear of this pinch
again further on.</p>
<p><a name="footnote160"></a><a href="#citation160"
class="footnote">[160]</a>&nbsp; This latter construction is
found to be very convenient, because the cargo is at one end of
the vessel and the machinery, and paddle-wheels, and steering
apparatus are all at the other end, so that orders can be readily
given to both by the captain.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Express&rdquo;
Company on the Seine has sixty of these steamers.</p>
<p><a name="footnote161"></a><a href="#citation161"
class="footnote">[161]</a>&nbsp; It was, however, only an
adaptation of the same principle I had used in Swedish lakes,
when my course was towards a bright sun so dazzling in the water
that I invented the plan of covering my eyes with my straw hat,
and steering the canoe by the bright reflection of the sun on its
cedar deck, which was of course by no means so unpleasant as the
beams of light glancing from the water itself.&nbsp; Surely it
would not be impossible to make the needle of a mariner&rsquo;s
compass itself steer the ship at least within half a point.&nbsp;
The motion of the needle could connect one or the other of two
electro currents, and so set in instant action a powerful
purchase to act on the tiller.</p>
<p><a name="footnote171"></a><a href="#citation171"
class="footnote">[171]</a>&nbsp; First thoughts of people and of
countries are more striking, they are only by chance at all
true.&nbsp; I recollect asking an American, after his visit to
the English House of Lords, what struck his attention most; and
he said, &ldquo;Their lordships don&rsquo;t seem to brush their
hair.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another clever traveller, from the same land
of our cousins, was asked what he noticed of our manners in
London, and he replied, &ldquo;I observe it is the fashion here,
when a gentleman sees his friend on the other side of Pall Mall,
he shakes his umbrella at him and calls out, &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye
do, old fellow?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote188"></a><a href="#citation188"
class="footnote">[188]</a>&nbsp; The Rob Roy came there again
next summer, up the Thames, and by the canal, and the river Wey
and the Arun, and so to Southsea, with fifteen canoes, five dogs
and a cockatoo&mdash;such fun.</p>
<p><a name="footnote192"></a><a href="#citation192"
class="footnote">[192]</a>&nbsp; After so much experience of the
yawl, tried in all points in all kinds of wind and weather, it
may well be supposed that numerous improvements had been noted in
my book as desirable.&nbsp; These, however, we need not here
particularise, as the various descriptions given at intervals
through this book shew what the Rob Roy is in her latest and best
arrangements.</p>
<p><a name="footnote195a"></a><a href="#citation195a"
class="footnote">[195a]</a>&nbsp; The fall of each halyard was
coiled and put under the taut part.&nbsp; A small coil looks
neatest, but the fall of it is sure to kink if coiled close,
being wet and dry ten times in a day.&nbsp; Before nearing
harbour, or in preparation to lower sail
&ldquo;handsomely,&rdquo; I found it well to cast the coil loose
on the hatch, else a kink would catch in the leading sheave.</p>
<p><a name="footnote195b"></a><a href="#citation195b"
class="footnote">[195b]</a>&nbsp; This was forthwith invented and
used and shewn to hundreds of people.&nbsp; After some time the
very identical thing was patented, and it is now used by
thousands.&nbsp; Most of our canoes have these &ldquo;tumbling
cleats,&rdquo; and they are used for the cords of blinds,
&amp;c., in many houses, including my own.</p>
<p><a name="footnote197"></a><a href="#citation197"
class="footnote">[197]</a>&nbsp; This is shewn in the sketch on
the preceding page; the bar presented a very smooth surface for
the bottom of the dingey to run over when it was shipped under
the hatch, or hauled out in a hurry.&nbsp; Moreover, the wood was
convenient to stride across in getting from the well to the
cabin, and it was far more pleasant and <i>warmer</i> than metal
to hold on by during violent lurches of the sea.</p>
<p><a name="footnote206"></a><a href="#citation206"
class="footnote">[206]</a>&nbsp; A foreign sailor, examined as to
a shipwreck case in Court, was asked, &ldquo;How did you know it
was the coast of England?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Because a
lifeboat came out to us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rule Britannia!</p>
<p><a name="footnote208"></a><a href="#citation208"
class="footnote">[208]</a>&nbsp; Three hundredweight of ballast
was thrown off at Cowes, besides what we took out at Dover, and
still the yawl was stiff.</p>
<p><a name="footnote211"></a><a href="#citation211"
class="footnote">[211]</a>&nbsp; Other inventors, knowing the
experimental turn of my crew, had sent me several instruments and
things of various sorts to try in practice, and to report
on.&nbsp; One of these was a beautiful little anchor made of
bronze, and in form very peculiar and apparently an improvement,
indeed an admirable novelty to look at.&nbsp; This, too, I heaved
overboard for trial, but it simply dragged through the soft mud,
and proved quite useless.</p>
<p><a name="footnote240"></a><a href="#citation240"
class="footnote">[240]</a>&nbsp; He had wisely fitted a
centre-board in his 14-feet canoe at my suggestion.&nbsp; This
sliding keel answered well for sailing, and all our large canoes
are now thus fitted.&nbsp; Mr. Berthons&rsquo; portable canoe can
be carried flat under one arm.&nbsp; Canoe sails are dangerous
unless they can be lowered in an instant.&nbsp; So are the sails
of a frigate in a sudden squall.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Eurydice,&rsquo; which I saw in Portsmouth harbour, is a
warning for ever.</p>
<p><a name="footnote242"></a><a href="#citation242"
class="footnote">[242]</a>&nbsp; To anchor for the night, riding
by tide or stream, is not pleasant; for then the wind may cross
your hatch, and blow the rain in sideways, whereas if you ride at
anchor to the wind alone, the draught comes always from the
front, and so it can be better provided for, and the boat does
not roll much even if she pitches.</p>

shroud.&nbsp; To hang it in front of you is simply to cut off two
of your three chances of possibly seeing ahead.</p>
<p><a name="footnote250"></a><a href="#citation250"
class="footnote">[250]</a>&nbsp; I think that in a port like
Newhaven the look-out man in charge ought to come to the
pier-head when he sees a yacht entering in rough weather, and
certainly there is more attention to such matters in France than
with us.</p>

were some of those we had been with in the morning, and they
looked even more in number, for we crossed and recrossed each
other frequently, and this part of the Channel is a highway for
nations.</p>
<p><a name="footnote267"></a><a href="#citation267"

was drowned, the last of six brothers, all of whom were
drowned.</p>
<p><a name="footnote268"></a><a href="#citation268"
class="footnote">[268]</a>&nbsp; This event is depicted on the
cover of our book, being a copy of the illustration in the
excellent penny periodical, &lsquo;The Boy&rsquo;s Own
Paper&rsquo; (October, 1879), one of a score of serials and a
thousand books at the &lsquo;Pure Literature Society,&rsquo; 11,
Buckingham Street, Strand.</p>
<p><a name="footnote270"></a><a href="#citation270"
class="footnote">[270]</a>&nbsp; One of the pranks to be prepared
for in a boat is this jibing of the boom, and until by practice
you know the exact range of safety for your head in relation to
that swinging spar, caution should be the rule.&nbsp; Long ago I
had learned the exact length of the Rob Roy&rsquo;s boom in
relation to my nose; for even in the Thames, soon after starting,
it had once caught the back of my head, and knocked my face down
on the deck, where a bloody nose (but no worse result) speedily
settled the question as to which must yield when the boom and the
captain are at loggerheads.&nbsp; I learned more lessons of this
sort when, in 1871, I had a lonely voyage in a &ldquo;yawl
canoe&rdquo; through Holland and the Zuyder Zee, and Friesland
and the Texel.&nbsp; An account of it was published in the
&lsquo;Graphic&rsquo; for November of that year.</p>
<p><a name="footnote272"></a><a href="#citation272"

lately there were forty ladies each in a canoe on one
afternoon.</p>
<p><a name="footnote275"></a><a href="#citation275"

on the Goodwin in the fearful gale that came soon afterwards.</p>
<p><a name="footnote280"></a><a href="#citation280"
class="footnote">[280]</a>&nbsp; The recent legislation for the
proper care of the women and the education of the children on
barges was much needed, and it was successfully accomplished by
our late excellent Home Secretary, who was himself one of the
best &ldquo;oars&rdquo; at Cambridge, when the late Foreign
Secretary of France was another.</p>
<p><a name="footnote284"></a><a href="#citation284"
class="footnote">[284]</a>&nbsp; The use of the word
&ldquo;bloody&rdquo; is now general among the lowest classes all
over England.&nbsp; The meaning intended by this is not what
scholars would agree to.&nbsp; Hundreds of times the word is
employed only for &ldquo;very,&rdquo; and it is strange how soon
one&rsquo;s first shudders at the sound become faint, and even
die.</p>

elected about 600 Members, including several ladies.&nbsp; Some
of the Members are in Australia, India, Japan, China, Canada, and

Commodore, and he has several canoes.&nbsp; There are also
several branches of the Club besides other Canoe Clubs on the
Mersey, the Clyde, the Forth, the Trent, the Humber, and four
Clubs in America.&nbsp; The Office of the R.C. Club is at 11,
Buckingham Street, Adelphi, London, where also is &ldquo;The Pure

good to read and to choose from.</p>

sharks should get entangled in the Bay of Biscay.&nbsp; Even at

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
